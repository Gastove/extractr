<b>Warm Farro Salad with Chickpeas, Feta, and Spicy Dressing</b><br />
<br />
I’ve found farro in Seattle at Whole Foods, PCC, and some grocery stores, or you can get it from <a href="http://chefshop.com/Farro-Emmer-Organic-P6425.aspx" target="_blank">ChefShop</a>. I like the farro grown by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluebirdgrainfarms.com/" target="_blank">Bluebird Grain Farms</a>&nbsp;of Winthrop, Washington. Farro should be soaked briefly before cooking, although Matthew often uses Trader Joe’s quick-cooking farro – done in 10 minutes! – and says that it’s great. In any case, I give instructions below for cooking standard farro, and hey, feel free to scale up and cook an even bigger batch, if you’d like. From one cup of uncooked farro, I wind up with enough cooked farro for three or four servings of this salad.<br />
<br />
Also: among types of feta, I like French feta best.<br />
<br />
<i>For the farro</i>:<br />
1 cup farro<br />
½ tsp. salt<br />
<br />
<i>For the dressing</i>:<br />
3 Tbsp. fish sauce<br />
3 Tbsp. lime juice<br />
2 to 3 Tbsp. (25 to 35 g) brown sugar<br />
6 to 8 Tbsp. water, to taste<br />
1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed<br />
1 Thai chile, very thinly sliced<br />
<br />
<i>For the salad</i>:<br />
Chickpeas, either canned (drained and rinsed) or cooked from dried<br />
Escarole, coarsely chopped or sliced<br />
Radicchio, coarsely sliced<br />
Carrots, sliced into rounds<br />
Feta, coarsely crumbled<br />
<br />
Put the farro in a medium (2 ½- to 3-quart) saucepan, add cold water to cover, and set it aside to soak for 30 minutes. Then drain the farro, put it back into the saucepan, and add 3 cups of cold water and ½ teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil; then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until tender but still a little chewy, about 45 minutes. It’s up to you, really, how “done” you want your farro. At 30 minutes, mine is usually too tough, but a few minutes later, it’s just right: al dente, but not exhausting to chew.  When it’s ready, drain it, and either use it while it’s warm&nbsp;or transfer it to a storage container for later use. (Covered and chilled, cooked farro will keep for a few days, easy.)<br />
<br />
To make the dressing, combine the fish sauce, lime juice, 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons of the water, the garlic, and chile in a small bowl. Whisk well. Taste: if it’s too pungent, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. If you’d like a little more sweetness, add more brown sugar ½ tablespoon at a time. (Covered and chilled, the dressing will keep for three days to a week.)<br />
<br />
To assemble a portion of salad, scoop out a couple of large spoonfuls of farro – maybe 1/3 to ½ cup – and put it in a wide bowl.  If the farro is cold, you might want to microwave it for 45 seconds or so, to warm it.  That’s what I do.  Or you could put it in a small ovenproof dish, covered, and bake it for a few minutes to warm it. Or you can just leave it cold.  Add a large spoonful of chickpeas, a good handful each of escarole and radicchio, and maybe half of a carrot, sliced.  Top with a generous amount of feta, and then drizzle some dressing – maybe a tablespoon? Or to taste – over the whole thing. Toss, and eat.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
