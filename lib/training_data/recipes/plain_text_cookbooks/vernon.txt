Recipes.

                      (vernon0003)
LESSON 1.
Pastry. Puff Paste.
Two cups flour, 1 cup of butter, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 teaspoonful sugar, 1/2
white of an egg, 1/2 cup of ice water. Wash the butter in ice water until it is
pliable. Cover the butter with ice until it is needed. Put the flour in another
bowl. Make a hole in the center, put in the salt, sugar, white of egg, and a
small lump of the washed butter, about the size of a hickorynut. Add the water
gradually until you have a dough you can knead. Turn it out on the board and
knead it as you would bread for a few minutes. Separate it in two pieces. Roll
each piece in a thin sheet. Wipe the butter dry, break in pieces, and place in
one sheet of the pastry. Dredge thickly with flour, place the other sheet on top.
Roll it out in a long thin strip and fold it in three folds. Repeat this rolling and
folding eight times, placing it on the ice at any time when it is too soft to roll
easily. It is then ready to use.
Plain Paste.
Three cups of flour, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 cupful of shortening, 1 cupful of
ice water. Put the flour in a bowl, add the salt and shortening. Cut the
shortening in small pieces and distribute through the flour. Add the water
gradually and carefully, so as not to make the paste too moist. Turn the paste


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                      (vernon0004)
out on the board and roll in a long sheet. Fold and roll again. Repeat the
process until you have a smooth paste. It is then ready to use.
Apple Custard Pie.
Line a pie plate with plain paste and bake it. Into a double boiler put one
cupful of milk. Mix together the yolks of 2 eggs. 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar
and 1/2 tablespoonful cornstarch, and add them to the milk when boiling. Stir
over a fire until it thickens. When the paste is baked put into it four apples,
cut in quarters and cooked until tender. Pour over these the custard. Make
a meringue with the whites of two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar.
Place this in spoonfuls on the pie and brown in the oven.
Paganini Tarts.
Cut puff paste into pieces two inches square. Fold in the corners until
they meet in the center. Brush first with white of egg, that they may stay in
place. Bake in a quick oven. When done fill with jam or jelly and cover with
a meringue. When it is brown they are ready to serve.
Cheese Fingers.
Roll puff paste very thin, sprinkle with strong, grated cheese, fold pastry
and roll again, cut into narrow, short strips. Bake. These are served with
salad.

Cheese Straws.
One half pound of cheese grated, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and the yolks of
2 eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly and roll in a thin sheet.
Cut into tiny rings and strips. Bake, being careful not to burn, as they bake
quickly. When ready to serve place 3 sticks in 2 rings.
Cheese Balls.
Make the same mixture as for cheese straws, form into balls, dip in white
of egg, adding one tablespoonful of water to each egg, and then in bread crumbs.
Fry in smoking fat.
Pates.
Roll puff paste 1/4 inch thick, with a pastry jagger cut into boat shape.
Place a strip of paste all around the edge, brushing between with white of egg to
stick them together. Bake slowly.
LESSON 2.
White Bread.

water, and sufficient flour to make a stiff batter. Let this stand from 2 to 4
hours or until light. Add flour sufficient to knead, turn out on board and
knead till it loses its stickiness. Put it again in a warm place till it doubles its
bulk, then mould very lightly into loaves, put into warm place till it doubles its
bulk and then bake. Make whole wheat bread in the same way, using entire
wheat flour.
French Rolls.
One cupful of milk, 1 yeast cake, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt. Scald the milk,
add to it 1 tablespoonful of butter and the salt. When lukewarm add the yeast
dissolved in lukewarm water and 2 cupfuls of flour. Stand it in a warm place
for 1/2 hour. Add additional flour, sufficient to make a dough that you can
knead. Knead it until it is soft and pliable and free from stickiness. Separate it
into small pieces and place these on a towel, cover and stand it in a warm place for
1/2 hour. Then form into fancy shapes in greased tins and bake in a quick
oven. When you take them out of the oven brush them with melted butter.
Cinnamon Buns.
One pint of flour, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 teaspoonful of baking powder, 1 table-
spoon butter, sufficient flour to make a dough you can knead. Mix flour, salt

Raglets.
One half cup butter, 1 cup water, 1 cup flour, 4 eggs. Place the water and
butter in a granite saucepan. When boiling, stir in the flour, stir till the batter
follows the spoon, then add one at a time the four eggs, beating well after each
egg. Put the mixture into a pastry bag and squeeze into deep fat which is
smoking hot. Fry till delicate brown and cover with a mixture of 1/2 cup of
granulated sugar and one tablespoon of cocoa or cinnamon.

the fire for at least one-half hour. Place it over the fire and bring quickly to
boiling point. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Strain it through
a napkin wet with cold water. Color with caramel and it is ready to use.
Quenelle Salad.
Boil a chicken until tender. Take all the meat from the bones and put
through the meat chopper. To every pint of meat add 2 eggs, a tablespoonful
of parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Form into small balls and boil in
chicken stock for three minutes. Serve on lettuce with mayonnaise. For the
dressing, put the yolk of one egg in a soup plate, stir with a fork until it
slightly thickens. Then add, drop by drop, olive oil until you have the re-
quired amount of dressing. If it becomes too thick to work easily, add a few
drops of vinegar or lemon juice. When done season with salt and pepper and
mustard if you wish. The addition of an equal quantity of whipped cream is
very nice.
