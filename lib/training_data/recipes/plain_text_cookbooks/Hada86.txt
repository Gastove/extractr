ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Three years ago when I volunteered to chair the committee
to rewrite the cookbook, I must admit to a certain naiveté. What
could there be, after all, to publishing a cookbook? Little did I real-
ize how many woman hours would be involved and how much fun
it would be.
This project owes its success to the women who devoted so
many hours of their time in the numerous tasks associated with
producing <I>Like Mama Used to Make...and More</I>. My deepest
thanks to the original committee members who assumed a myriad
of tasks in addition to making the initial decisions and culling
through new and old recipes: Betty Becker, Carol Finerman,
Miriam Garvil, Rachel Jacobs, Esther Pascal, Jeanne Robbins,
Sheila Silver and Doris Miller. Warm thanks to Marilyn Krimm for
her assistance. In addition, I would like to single out the following:
Helen Mann and Sarajane Silver who typed the manuscript and
Hilary Gans and Rae Juni who assisted in proofreading; Ricky
Lauffer for her wonderful illustrations, Harlene Appleman for her
text on the holidays and Fay Woronoff for her insights through the
historical notes; and most especially to Carol Finerman for taking
on the awesome job as editor and to Judy Stopke for her expertise
in design and production.
My appreciation also to all those who submitted recipes, so that
this book could pass on a culinary heritage, just like Mama used to
make, to a new generation.

HISTORIC NOTES
It was an evening Study Group meeting in October of 1951 at
which we munched delicious baked goods and exchanged their
mimeographed recipes, that someone suggested, "Why don't we
collect all our favorite receipes and put out a cookbook?" The
spark caught fire and produced an awesome degree of participa-
tion on the part of Chapter members, culminating in a product that
fulfilled our entire financial quota for several years, the book Like
<BI>Mama used to Make.</BI> The enthusiastic involvement on the part of
the many talented women on whose resources we were able to
draw produced, after only a year's work, a cookbook that became
known and treasured all over the country, as well as abroad.
Suzanne Sarnoff, as chairperson, designed and illustrated, with
Jan Miller's assistance, a volume of exceeding charm and wit but,
most importantly, one comprised of excellent, typically Jewish rec-
ipes shared by our Chapter's most proficient cooks.
<BI>Like Mama Used to Make</BI> was copyrighted on December 16,
1952 and its sales took off beyond our most optimistic expecta-
tions. Because of our extensive publicity and also because of the
nature of our university community, with students and faculty
members coming from and going to other locales, the visibility of
the book became widespread. Once seen, it virtually sold itself.
Individual and multiple copies could be purchased locally and
through the mail, and other Hadassah chapters and sisterhoods
bought them in quantity at reduced prices for their own fund-rais-
ing. Orders poured in from Canada, England, Israel, Japan,
Guam, France and South Africa, as well as from literally every
state in the nation.
A copy was requested by the Jewish Welfare Board's Ser-
vicemen's Center in Germany to help them bring '"a touch of
home' to the Jewish boys through these Jewish traditional deli-
cacies and dishes."
In 1956 permission was requested by and granted to the Chil-
dren and Youth Aliyah Committee for Great Britain to reprint the
cookbook in the United Kingdom.
In 1963 the Youth Aliyah Committee in Amsterdam made the
same request, translating excerpts into Dutch.
After many thousands of copies of <BI>Like Mama Used to Make</BI>
were sold, some of the original recipes were revised in 1974 for a
new edition.
We have now undertaken a further, more extensive revision to be
more in keeping with today's eating habits, our concern with calo-
ries and cholesterol, and our newer methods of food preparation.
We have, however, steadfastly sought to maintain the same tam
that made our Jewish recipes so special and so valued over the
years. <BI>Like Mama Used to Make...and More</BI> is just that. Enjoy!
---Fay Woronoff

EDITOR'S NOTE
This project was conceived in late spring of 1984, when I was
president of the Ann Arbor Chapter of Hadassah. We wanted to
modernize the recipes to bring them in line with current thinking
about nutrition, and incorporate the use of the latest kitchen equip-
ment on our tried and true recipes. What made <BI>Like Mama Used
to Make</BI> and our new version, <BI>Like Mama Used to Make...and
More</BI> so popular and so special, is its <I>tam</I>, the love written in every
recipe as grandaughters painstakingly measured Grandma's
"handful" and we learned to convert the contents of a <I>yahrzeit</I>
glass to a standard measuring cup.
Many recipes were submitted with accompanying stories of their
origin, which we've included. There were requests to keep favorite
recipes from the old cookbook, and in this we tried to accommo-
date as many as possible. Many new recipes are quite traditional,
handed down from grandmother, Mama, aunts and friends. There
are also new recipes which take into account diet restrictions, and
many more recipes in our vegetable section.
We hope you like the new look of our book, but be assured that
within its covers, on its sleek, newly designed pages, are the reci-
pes that we love and treasure. We hope you will too.

Kashruth
JEWISH DIETARY LAWS
The recipes in <B>Like Mama Used to Make...and More</B>, whether
traditional or modern, follow the precepts of kosher dietary laws.
Foods used in these recipes are acceptable in a kosher kitchen.
Meats are from the forequarters of animals which have cloven
hooves and chew their cud (the cow, sheep, goat and deer---
although the latter two are seldom used in the United States).
The hindquarters may also be used, but they generally are not be-
cause of the costs to remove the veins and fatty portions which
must be done to make the meat kosher.
Poultry such as chicken, turkey and geese are permitted. Fish
which have both fins and scales are allowed. Vegetables, fruits,
processed cheeses and eggs are also permitted; however eggs
which have a speck of blood are not kosher and must be dis-
carded, for any sign of blood means that fertilization has taken
place.
Today, a kosher butcher while observing the laws of ritual
slaughter, offers meats pre-kashered, salted and pre-packaged for
the shopper. A large number of supermarkets have a separate
section for kosher meats, either fresh or pre-packaged and frozen.
Many products bear the symbols U and K which symbolize their
suitability in a kosher kitchen.
Milk and meat products are never used together. This has its
foundation in the Bible: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's
milk." Meat, or foods containing meat, are never cooked, served or
eaten with milk or foods containing milk. Some foods are consid-
ered neutral or <I>pareve</I> (fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs) and may be
prepared and eaten with dairy or meat meals. The observant cook
will check package ingredients and consult with a rabbi if there is
any question as to whether or not a food is permissible. Observant
homes will also have a set of dishes and utensils for meat (<I>fleishik</I>),
another set for dairy (<I>milkhik</I>), as well as complete sets for
Passover.

HOLIDAYS
Jewish life has a special rhythm. The Scriptures instruct us to pray
three times daily, following the cycle of light and darkness, morning
and evening. Our weeks follow a certain rhythm, as well, building
toward the crescendo of Shabbat. Our year follows the rhythm of
the holidays with special pauses tied to wonderful celebrations. Fi-
nally, our lives are attuned to those times we call life cycle events:
birth, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, marriage and death.
Entwined in this cadence are the wonderful foods that mark
those special occasions and celebrations: the tcholent and kugels
of Shabbat (not to mention the chicken soup and challah), the
honey cakes, teiglach and tzimmis that combine to make a sweet
New Year and, of course, the sponge cake, matzo balls and count-
less matzo meal delicacies that separate Passover from the rest of
the year.
The offerings that follow are filled with an almost reverent respect
for the Jewish way of celebrating and remembering the rhythm of
life. In Judaism, one's table is considered an alter, and the most
precious offerings are placed upon it. These recipes, simple or
complex, have all received the attention and care that make them
worthy to grace any table. We hope they bring you pride and hap-
piness as you prepare them.
Shabbat
"Even the poor are rich on Shabbat," it is said, and since
Shabbat is a taste of the world to come, the culinary delights of
such a day should be fitting. If you have ever tasted warm challah
fresh from the oven, you must surely acknowledge that this is a
heavenly experience. Add to that the Shabbos fish (gefilte or sweet
and sour), the chicken soup and a wonderful kugel, and what fam-
ily would not equate you with the Shabbos Angel?
Traditionally, it is customary to put a few coins in the Tzedakah
box just before lighting the Shabbos candles. Then mother pre-
pares at least two candles which are lit up to eighteen minutes be-
fore sunset. Some families light an additional candle for each child
in the house. Children are blessed: "May the Lord make you like
Ephraim and Menaskeh" (for the males) and "May the Lord make
you like Sarah, Rebekah and Leah" (for the girls). Then "Shalom
Aleicheim"---May peace be with you---is sung.
Kiddish is recited, the challah cover is removed and Hamotzi (the
blessing over the bread) is made. Some people tear the challah
because to use a knife introduces a warlike connotation to some-
thing that is supposed to be peaceful.
This entire ceremony takes only a few moments in Hebrew or
English, but within those moments, a pause that separates the
humdrum monotony of the weekdays from the peace of Shabbat,
has been created.

Rosh Hashanah
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, brings with it hopes
and dreams for the coming year and a variety of traditional foods to
accentuate these positive thoughts.
A round challah symbolizes the cyclical nature of the year---the
ending of the old year and the beginning of the new. Also the round
challah looks like a crown to remind us of the Torah's royal crown.
This challah traditionally has raisins and dried fruits throughout.
Apples and honey: apples because they symbolize fertility and
abundance; and honey because it was thought to have re-
generative powers, and it was sweet, symbolizing the hope for a
sweet year to come.
Fish represents fertility and proliferation.
A fruit new to the season. When we recite a Sheheheyanu two
nights in a row, on the second, the fruit is in full view.
Carrots (or marin in Yiddish) also means to increase or multiply.
Thus carrots symoblize the wish for prosperity in the coming year.

Yom Kippur
The holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur, is the Sabbath of all
Sabbaths. It is a twenty-four hour period that is traditionally de-
voted to prayer, fasting and atonement. The day focuses on spir-
itual needs. Physical needs are temporarily set aside so that we
can concentrate more fully on asking G-d's forgiveness for the
transgressions of the past year.
However, since Yom Kippur is a festival, the meal preceding it is
considered to be a feast. Challot are served, although some fami-
lies shape them like birds, with braided ladders on their wings.
This symbolizes the flight of man's prayers to heaven. The sweet
and sumptuous food from Rosh Hashanah is traditionally eaten on
Erev Yom Kippur (Yom Kippur Eve) as well, along with one addi-
tion---kreplach. Kreplach were once edible amulets. They con-
tained hopeful messages and mystical incantations carved into
their doughy surfaces. Thus, eating them on Yom Kippur was sup-
posed to make wishes come true.

Sukkoth
Five days after Yom Kippur comes Sukkoth. Like many other
holidays, Sukkoth has dual origins: it is both a historic and agri-
cultural holiday; it represents the journey of the people of Israel
through the desert after the exodus from Egypt. During this time
people lived in booths of an impermanent nature. Sukkoth also cel-
ebrated the fall harvest and involved a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
As a family celebration, Sukkoth can be incredibly rich. The pur-
chase of a lulav (the combination of date palm, myrtle and willow
leaves) and etrog (the citron) makes an important addition to the
holiday. Building a sukkah and using it for family meals and enter-
taining, creates an experience that once tried will not be aban-
donded. This holiday is a particular delight to children. All of the
senses and tactile experiences of this weeklong celebration---
from the hanging of fruits and vegetables to decorate the sukkah,
eating the family meals out-of-doors, to the culmination of the cele-
bration of Simchat Torah, on the eighth day, when all the Torahs are
taken out of the ark and the congregation dances and rejoices in
the synagogue as they are paraded around seven times---all
create the kinds of Jewish memories that promote tradition.
CHECK LIST
? Round challah with challah
cover
? Two candles
? Kiddush cup
? Wine
? Lulav and etrog
? Fresh flowers for the holiday
table
? A sukkah
TRADITIONAL
SUKKOTH MENU:
Challah, apples, taiglach and
round fruitcakes carry out the
tradition of round foods for the
holiday.
Because it is traditional to eat in
the sukkah, other holiday foods
are hot, spicy and substantial:
stuffed cabbage, cabbage borscht
or stuffed veal breast.
Hot cider sipped through cin-
Namon sticks.
Chanukah
Chanukah means dedication in Hebrew. It refers specifically to
the rededication of the ancient Temple after it had been dese-
crated by the Syrians. It is also the Festival of Lights. These two
facets of the holiday: the rededication of the Temple and the em-
phasis on light during the dark winter days, come together in the
Chanukah story about the cruse of oil. When the Temple was des-
ecrated and the Eternal Light burning in it was extinguished, the
Maccabees were able to save one small cruse of oil that burned for
eight days and nights until more oil could be prepared.
This story gives rise to the custom of lighting candles for eight
days, one for each day of the holiday, and the custom of eating food
cooked in oil such as latkes and doughnuts. Children play the
dreidl game, a spinning top with Hebrew letters on four sides; they
are the initials of the words which explain the mystery of the oil in
the lamp and the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrians. Nes
Gadol Haya Shim---"A great miracle happened here." Rock of
Ages is sung after the candles are lighted. Gifts are usually given
to children, including money, known as Chanukah "gelt".
CHECKLIST
? Menorah that holds nine
candles
? 44 candles
? Dreidl - a four-cornered top with
Hebrew letters, used for games
of chance
? Chanukah "gelt" - money (real
or chocolate) to be used as
prizes for the dreidl game
? Latkes (potato or buckwheat
pancakes) and jelly doughnuts

Purim
Purim can be a glorious celebration with all of the ingredients
for great parties: masquerades, gift-giving, Purim plays and cha-
rades. It is a holiday that can be as sophisticated or as child-ori-
ented as you care to make it, but it is always fun. In the synagogue,
the Megillah (Book of Esther) is read and retells the story of Esther
who is married to King Ahasueros. Moredeccai, Esther's uncle, re-
fuses to bow down to Haman, the king's advisor, so Haman plots to
murder all the Jews. Esther intervenes with the King and saves her
people. As the story is read, there are cheers for the names of Es-
ther and Mordeccai, but loud stamping of feet and sounding the
graggers (noisemakers) whenever Haman's name is mentioned.
We celebrate the victory of the Jews over anti-Semitism then, and
down through the ages.
Aside from the merriment, traditional observances include giv-
ing Mishloach Manot, the exchange of food gifts among friends.
These can include hamantashen (three-cornered pastries filled
with poppyseeds or prunes and said to be shaped like Haman's
ears), nuts, fresh fruit and a small bottle of wine or schnapps.
CHECKLIST
? Graggers (noisemakers)
? Hamantashen - pastries filled
with poppyseeds, prunes or a
variety of other fillings
? Mishloach Manot - baskets of
goodies to send to friends
? Challah and a challah cover
? Wine or liquor, because it is tra-
ditional to get so intoxicated
that you cannot tell the dif-
ference between Haman and
Mordeccai
? Matanot L'Evyonian - it is tradi-
tional to give at least one penny
each to two poor people. Purim
is a particularly fitting time to
give a gift to charities that re-
lieve world hunger
Passover
Passover is a springtime celebration of freedom and renewal.
The holiday commemorates the beginnings of Jewish peoplehood
and the exodus from Egypt. It begins on the fifteenth day of Nissan
and continues for eight days, during which no leavened food may
be eaten. Passover is one of three pilgrimage holidays (the others
are Shavuoth and Sukkoth) and serves as a means to gather peo-
ple together to celebrate the beginnings of a new agricultural year.
We celebrate Passover at a Seder meal: a great feast which incor-
porates many traditional Jewish foods, and during which the story
of the exodus from Egypt is retold, lest the Jewish people forget
that they were slaves in Egypt. It is an injunction to all those at the
Seder table to pass the story down to a new generation and to re-
peat it to all who are present so that it may endure.
It is customary to invite guests to the Seder following the injunc-
tion in the Haggadah: "Let all who are hungry come and eat." In
addition to the traditional four questions which precipitate the tell-
ing of the Passover story, modern families encourage the asking of
new questions in order to encourage their children's participation.
From the explanation of all the symbolic foods, through to the great
feast and general camaraderie, Passover is a very family-oriented,
warm holiday.
CHECKLIST

Shavuoth
Shavuoth, the Festival of the Torah, is one of the three major
pilgrimage holidays. This holiday is introduced at Passover, when
the counting of the omer (the 49 days between Passover and
Shavuoth) is begun. Shavuoth is a beautiful holiday with its flowers
and plants. It is significant because it celebrates the giving of the
Torah to Moses on Mt. Sinai.
It is traditional to eat dairy foods on this holiday and the best
cheesecakes and blintzes are generally on parade. It is a perfect
time to set up an ice-cream bar with lots of toppings.

1 envelope onion soup
mix
2 6 1/2 oz. cans white
tuna packed in
water, drained
2 T. soy sauce
1 can bean sprouts,
well drained
1 4-oz. can mush-
rooms, well
drained, chopped
oil for frying

stock)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 T. oil
1 1/4 c. sugar
1 t. salt
1 t. dark soy sauce
1 can pineapple
chunks, drained
(optional)
Beat egg; blend in flour. Mix all remaining in-
gredients in food processor or blender. Add
them to the egg and flour mixture. Preheat oil
to 350° in frying pan. Carefully drop mixture
by teaspoonful into oil. Remove as they
brown; drain puffs on paper toweling. Serve
covered with sweet and sour sauce in chaf-
ing dish.
For sweet and sour sauce, mix cornstarch

dients to a boil. Add cornstarch mixture to
thicken sauce.
Freeze in layers without sauce if making
ahead. Defrost completely and reheat in
300° oven for about 10-15 minutes.
<I>This recipe is from my sister-in-law, JoAnn
Arenson. Many people will think they are
meatballs, but will not be able to determine
the "secret" ingredient.</I>

MINIATURE EGG ROLL (Pareve)
1 c. onion, chopped
1 c. bean sprouts (if
canned, drain well)
1 c. celery, chopped
1 c. mushrooms, sliced
(if canned, drain
well)
oil
soy sauce
1 recipe blintze dough
or purchased won
ton wrappers
SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE:
1/4 c. cornstarch
1/2 c. water
12 oz. apricot preserves
1/3 c. white vinegar
3 T. honey
1/4 t. powdered ginger
1/3 c. ketchup
1/3 c. sherry
1 T. soy sauce
Sauté vegetables in a little oil (sesame is
nice if you have it). Add soy sauce to taste.
Place 1/2 teaspoon of filling in center of a
small wrapper. Roll up and tuck in corners
well. Deep fat fry in vegetable oil at 350°.
Serve as hors d'oeuvres with sweet and sour
sauce.
For sweet and sour sauce, mix cornstarch
with water. Bring all ingredients to a boil over
medium heat stirring frequently to prevent
burning. Reduce to simmer and thicken with
cornstarch and water mixture.
<I>If using won ton wrappers, these may be
made ahead and frozen, but do not over-
brown the first time. Reheat by thawing
completely and re-frying briefly (until
golden). They will be slightly better if made
fresh, but if you must save time, they will still
be fine if you reheat them this way. Oil from
frying the first time can be strained through
cheese cloth and stored in the refrigerator.
These have been served so many times at
bar and bat mitzvahs that they may now be
considered authentic Jewish forshpeis.</I>

"GEDECHTE" (THICK) SOUP
1 pkg. Manischewitz
Vegetable Soup Mix
with Mushrooms
1/4 lb. dried lima beans
1/8 lb. dried green split
peas
2-3 marrow bones
1 lb. chuck
2 large carrots, sliced
2 stalks celery, cut up
1 medium onion, cut up
1/4 c. small pasta
(optional)
salt
fresh-ground pepper
Set aside the mushroom-and-flavor packet
of the soup mix. In a strainer, wash the rest of
the contents of the soup mix and also the
lima beans and split peas. Cover well with
water and let stand overnight to shorten
cooking time or else bring to a boil and con-
tinue cooking at once. Add marrow bones
and chuck. (Meat may be cooked in a sepa-
rate pot or a pressure cooker; cool, skim off
all fat that rises to top of stock. Stock should
then be added to the cooking vegetables to
give flavor.) When lima beans start to feel
somewhat soft to the touch of a fork, add the
fresh vegetables and continue to cook, stir-
ring bottom often. Remove meat when
tender if it was cooked in the main pot and
cool slightly, or else use meat which was
boiled by itself. Trim off all fat, cut meat into
cubes and add to soup. Add salt and pepper
to taste---at least 2 teaspoons salt. About 1/2
hour before the end of the cooking time, add
the mushroom-and-flavor packet of the soup
mix and the additional pasta.

FRUIT SOUP
fruits as available:
cantaloupe, water-
melon, honeydew;
wedges of each,
peeled and diced
grapes, pitted sweet
cherries
1 can sour pitted
cherries
1 diced apple
currants, dates,
raisins, plums,
peaches; pitted
and diced
1 slice lemon
1 c. orange juice
oranges, grapefruit;
peeled, dried and
diced
sweet wine
OR sugar to taste
To decide on the amount of fruit, you must
first pick your soup pot. Fill the pot half-full
with any combination of fruit, always includ-
ing sour cherries and a lemon. Cover the
fruit with cold water and juice to about VA"
from the top of the pan to allow room for boil-
ing. Bring all to a rolling boil, letting boil for
about five minutes. Let cool. Now there are
2 choices:
1) Strain soup, saving liquid and fruit sepa-
rately. Purée fruit via food processor or
blender briefly. Mix with liquid or
2) Leave soup with large pieces of fruit.
Next step is important regardless of whether
you use step 1 or 2. Taste as to need for
sweet wine OR sugar. Do not oversweeten
or you will lose the subtleties of the flavors of
the fruits. Refrigerate. Serve cold. Can be
frozen successfully.

when cold. Garnish with melon balls and
mint if desired.

LUKSHEN (Noodles)
1 egg
2/3 c. flour (approximate)
pinch of salt
Mix ingredients and knead until dough is soft
and elastic. Roll out on a floured board to a
thin even sheet. Let this dry until it is no
longer sticky, but not so dry that it will be brit-
tle. Fold into a flat narrow roll about 2" wide;
with a sharp knife cut crosswise into very
fine strips and toss them up lightly to sepa-
rate them. Spread on a board or cloth to dry
thoroughly before storing in jars. For broad
noodles cut in strips W or W wide; separate
and dry.
To prepare noodles, boil in salted water until
tender. Drain and add to soup. Or the noo-
dles may be cooked for 15-20 minutes di-
rectly in the soup if preferred.
EINLAUF OR TRIFLACH (Egg Drop for Soup)
1 egg
2 T. flour
pinch of salt

fall either in small drops or in a steady thin
stream which will give the effect of noodles.
Cover and boil for 5 minutes.
FARFEL (Egg Barley)
1 egg
1 c. flour
pinch of salt
Knead all ingredients into a hard firm ball of
dough. Grate on a medium fine grater.
Spread on a board to dry thoroughly before
storing away in jars. When needed, cook in
boiling salted water for 30 minutes. Drain
and serve in chicken soup, or as a side dish
with fat and gravy. The farfel may be boiled
directly in the soup if preferred.
MANDLEN (Soup Nuts)
3 eggs
2 T. oil
2 c. flour (approximate)
1 t. salt
Mix all ingredients, using only enough of the
flour to make a soft dough just firm enough
to roll with the hands. Divide the dough into 2
or 3 parts and roll with hands into ropes 3/8"
thick. Cut into 1/2" pieces. Place on well
greased cookie sheet and bake at 375° until
golden brown. Shake pan occasionally or
turn nuts, so that they brown evenly on all
sides. Use as a garnish.

MARINATED EGGPLANT SALAD
1 large eggplant
1/2 c. white vinegar
3 c. water
1/4 t. black peppercorn
3-5 whole bay leaves
1/2 t. salt
2 t. sugar
1 handful fresh dill,
chopped or
2 t. dried dill
3/4 c. mayonnaise
Mix dill with mayonnaise; set aside. Cut egg-
plant into sticks about finger-size, first cut-
ting into slices. In a pot large enough to hold
eggplant, make the marinade. Bring to a boil
vinegar, water, spices, salt and sugar. Add
eggplant. Marinade should cover eggplant.
Do not stir. Cover and simmer until eggplant
begins to look transparent. Turn into colan-
der to drain and cool. Remove bay leaves;
save. Do not remove peppercorns. When
cool, using a wooden spoon, fold in mayon-
naise. Decorate with bay leaves and enjoy.
<I>How I learned to make MARINATED EGGPLANT SALAD, and a few
other things...
The year was 1936; I was a fairly new arrival in Haifa, and had not yet
learned to speak, read or write Hebrew. A young teenager, alone, and like so
many other girls, I was staying temporarily at the Beth Hachalutzoth. I
heard of a cookery course, and, perhaps rashly, registered as a student.
Throughout the first day in class I sat there feeling what the builders of the
Tower of Babel must have felt. The course was to last for three months, and
the prospect of sitting through so much time in empty isolation was more
than I could bear. I came to class armed with a thick wad of blank papers,
and a lot of sharpened pencils, and hung on the teacher's lips for all my life
was worth, taking down every sound she uttered. I understood nothing. The
only alphabet I knew was the Roman alphabet and the sounds I took down
were a phonetic representation of Hebrew in Roman letters.
Each evening I scoured the corridors of the Beth Hachalutzoth in search of
some girl who was willing to work with me for an hour or two, and was usually
lucky. I would slowly read to her the succession of sounds I had taken during
class. The girl would extract from this medley the beginnings and ends of
words as each became recognizable to her, until a sentence would begin to
emerge. It was exciting to watch her face light up with recognition, and im-
mediately she'd translate the Hebrew into German or Yiddish, whichever
was functioning as the common language between us. At last I could fully
understand what I had observed in class in the way of practical work. I im-
mediately began scribbling again, this time writing down the recipes we had
prepared that morning, and all the instructions that went with them.
Needless to say, I managed to acquire quite a bit of knowledge of Hebrew,
and by the end of the course was able not only to pass the exams, but I had
also compiled a cookbook in a language I could read. When I showed my
cookbook to the teacher some months later, she politely admired it, but sug-
gested that it might be a good idea if I were to translate it all into Hebrew, so
that she and others might be able to read and understand it too!</I>

EGGPLANT CASSEROLE
2 eggplants
water, salted
1 large onion, cut up
1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms
1 can mushroom soup
(or tomato sauce,
tomato soup or
canned tomatoes)
1 c. bread stuffing mix
Skin and cube eggplants; boil in lightly
salted water for 10 minutes; drain. Saute
onion in oil till translucent with a tinge of
brown. Add washed, sliced mushrooms and
cook 5 minutes more. Combine all the above
with mushroom soup and crumbs and pour
into a 10" round x 2" deep casserole. Bake at
350° for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
<I>For variations, you may add 2 or more
beaten eggs, some tofu and cheese of your
choice to make a protein meal. (Any or all of
the preceding may be used.) If you use
tomato sauce or tomato soup, use oregano
and garlic for seasoning. A Mediterranean
version is made by adding additional
canned tomatoes and anchovies, gar-
nished with artichoke hearts and olives.
This may be served hot or cold.</I>

do not congeal. This serves 8 generously as
a side dish. To use as a main dish, add more
eggs.

POTATO KNISHES
DOUGH:
2 c. flour
1/2 t. salt
1 egg
3 T. chicken fat
1 c. cold water
FILLING:
2 c. mashed potatoes
2 large onions, diced
gribenes ("as much as
you can lay your
hands on")
salt, pepper to taste
Sift dry ingredients into a bowl. Make a well
in the center and add egg and fat. Stir to
combine and add a little water at a time to
make dough firm enough to handle. Toss
onto a floured board and knead for about 3
minutes. Divide dough into 2 parts and roll
each separately. Roll as thin as possible,
rolling from edge toward the center.
Sauté the onions in chicken fat until golden
brown. Add to the potatoes along with the
gribenes cut into small pieces. Add enough
chicken fat to make the mixture have a sticky
consistency. Season to taste.
Put filling on dough in a line across one end
of the dough. Roll as for jelly roll until filling is
covered with 2 layers of dough. Cut off the
roll and put another line of filling on dough,
etc., repeating process until all dough and
filling is used up. Cut the long rolls into
pieces of desired size by pressing down on
the roll with the pinky finger side of the hand
all the way to the bottom so that the top layer
of dough sticks to the bottom layer. Then cut
completely through with a sharp knife. Turn
the cake so one cut edge is down and the
second cut edge shows on the top. Flatten a
little with the palm of the hand, being careful
not to press open the sealed edge and
expose the filling.
Bake on a very well greased cookie sheet at
375° until brown. Baste once or twice during
baking with melted chicken fat. These can
be made in any desired size.

Bess Paper
KNISHE DOUGH MADE WITH POTATOES
2-3 potatoes, boiled and
mashed
3 eggs
3 c. flour
1 t. salt
Mix potatoes and eggs until smooth. Add
enough flour and salt to make a dough that
can be rolled. Roll dough out on a floured
board or cloth to 1/8" thickness. This can be
cut into individual rounds and filled, or
spread with filling and rolled as for a jelly roll
and then cut into serving pieces. Bake on a
well greased pan in a 375° oven until brown,
or deep fry, according to preference. Any fill-
ing may be used.
Another method is to pat half the dough
evenly onto the bottom of a well greased
square baking dish. Cover dough with a
layer of filling, then cover filling sandwich
style with a top layer of dough. Bake and cut
into squares to serve.

VERENICKES
DOUGH:
2 glasses flour
2 eggs (if you feel like it)
some water (How
much? Like 2
more eggs.)
FILLING #1: (may be a
main dish)
Grind together in meat
grinder:
leftover pot roast
leftover roasted potatoes
leftover roasted onions
FILLING #2:
mashed potatoes
onions, sautéed in
chicken fat
Mix ingredients into a dough. Roll in a long
roll about 1 1/4" in diameter. Cut in 3/4" rounds;
roll each individually into 5" circles. Place
small amount of filling in center of circles;
fold over dough into half circles. Pinch
edges tight, fluting edges with fingers by
folding bottom edge over top edge over and
over again. Drop in boiling salted water.
Cook 20 minutes; drain. Add a "glop" of
chicken fat (about 3 tablespoons) to pot and
coat verenickes. Sprinkle with salt.
Get them to the table fast, before they
disappear!
The dough ingredients were recorded ver-
batim from my great-grandmother, Dubba
Yucht (Yacht). The "glasses" of flour are
yahrzeit glasses. An "egg" of water is an
eggshell filled with water. The directions
and fillings are my mother's translations.

TWO STORIES
When I asked my mother for a blintze recipe, not only did she send a recipe,
but a paper pattern, numbered, so I would know exactly how to fold my
dough.
When my grandmother made kreplach for Shavuot, she would wrap a dish
towel around the pot and put it to bed, under the pillow, to keep the kreplach
warm. You might call that the earliest microwave oven!
Carol Finerman
RUMANIAN STYLE MEAT KNISHES
Dough made with
potatoes
liver (beef, calf, or
chicken)
leftover cooked
meat
onions, minced and
fried
garlic to taste
pepper to taste
chicken fat
Par-boil liver until tender. Put it through
the meat grinder along with leftover meat,
if it is being used. Add fried onions
and seasonings; mix well. Add enough
chicken fat to hold mixture together.
Roll dough on a lightly floured board to 1/8"
thickness. Place filling in little mounds on
half of the area of the dough. Distance
between mounds will be determined by size
of knishes desired. Fold empty half of dough
over the side with the mounds of filling. Cut
out rounds by placing a floured juice glass or
other cutter around each spot where filling
has been placed. Make sure edges are
completely sealed.
Fry knishes a few at a time in hot deep fat
(vegetable shortening) until brown. Drain.
Place them in covered casserole and put
into a 250-300° oven for 30-45 minutes.
Watch to see that too much moisture doesn't
collect. If so, remove cover. Knishes should
come out light and puffy.
The amounts used are up to the individual's
own judgment, and will depend on
personal taste, number and size of the
knishes being made. These can be made
rather large and served as the major part of
a meal, or can be extremely tiny, and used
as an excellent hors d'oeuvre.
These knishes are made in the true
Rumanian style. The Hungarian people
sometimes add sweet and sour cabbage
and chicken gribenes to the filling.

POTATO BLINTZES
BATTER:
1 egg
1/2 c. flour
1/2 t. salt
1 t. sugar
1/2 c. milk (or water)
FILLING:
3 potatoes, boiled and
mashed
2 medium onions,
minced
1 egg
salt, pepper to taste
Beat egg well. Gradually add flour, salt and
sugar to make a smooth paste. Add milk
slowly, thinning mixture until it is practically
a liquid. Beat constantly so there are no
lumps.
Put about 3 tablespoons of batter on a hot
well greased skillet about 8" in diameter.
Turn pan from side to side in order to spread
batter quickly. Fry until light brown on 1 side
only. Turn onto a cloth, fried side up.
Sauté onions in butter until brown; add to
mashed potatoes. Beat egg and add to mix-
ture. Season and beat until smooth and
fluffy.
Place filling in center of each pancake on the
fried side. Fold dough over in envelope fash-
ion. Fry each blintze in butter until golden
brown. Serve with sour cream.
The unfried blintzes can be kept in the ice-
box overnight and fried when needed. Re-
move from the icebox 1-2 hours before ser-
ving time so filling isn't ice cold when fried.
When making larger quantities than given
above, use 1 potato to fill every 2 blintzes.

POTATO RICE (from India)
1/2 lb. potatoes
1 c. oil
10 onions (small size)
2 chili peppers, seeded
(you may omit or
substitute sweet
pepper)
1 T. each: mustard seed,
caraway, dill
2 T. each: dried gar-
banzos, poppy
seeds
1/2 c. cashews
3 peeled cardamom
3 cloves
1/3 stick cinnamon
1 c. brown rice
2 1/2 c. water
saffron (optional)
Boil potatoes till half done; cool, peel and
cube. In a 12" skillet, sauté onions (which
have been cubed), till slightly browned. Add
peppers and rest of the ingredients. As each
ingredient is sautéed till slightly browned,
move it to the side of the skillet. Add the rice
last and brown in the remaining oil. Add the
water, bring to a boil and simmer45 minutes.
Now add the potatoes, 15minutes before it is
finished. Saffron is traditional as a coloring
and flavoring agent. If you would like to add
it, do so at the time you add the water.
Serve with poultry or beef, or as a protein
source for a vegetarian meal.

MAMALÍGA (CORN MEAL MUSH BREAD)
16 oz. lightly salted water
12 oz. yellow corn meal
Bring water to a boil. Gradually sift in corn
meal, stirring continuously until a mush is
formed, about 15 minutes. Keep stirring until
mush is very smooth. Cover the pot and
cook for about 10 minutes more. Turn onto a
wooden board and serve.
Mamaliga may be served hot or cold with
any dish instead of bread. My favorite
combination is with distinctively flavored
cheese (brinza) like Danish bleu, Gorgonzola
or Roquefort.

VEGETARIAN LASAGNA
3 cloves garlic
2 containers ricotta
cheese
1 lb. mozarella cheese
1 c. Parmesan (and/or
Romano cheese)
3 eggs (or less, depend-
ing on cholesterol
conscience)
9 lasagna noodles
1 28-oz. can tomato
solids
1 large can tomato
sauce
2 large onions, diced
1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced
1 green pepper, diced
2 large carrots, diagon-
ally sliced
3 zucchini, sliced
3 T. olive oil
Spices:
a pinch cumin
1/2 t. lemon-pepper
1/4 t. basil or oregano
Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of water
with salt and a few drops of olive oil until al
dente. Then cool with cold water. In the olive
oil, sauté the garlic, add the onion, carrots,
zucchini, mushrooms and green peppers;
sauté gently. When tender, add tomato sol-
ids, tomato sauce and spices. Simmer 1
hour. Add a dollop of red wine if desired.
Separate the eggs. Beat the egg whites until
firm and set aside. To the beaten egg yolks,
add the ricotta cheese and beat with a whisk
or electric beater until combined. Then add
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese; combine.
Fold in the egg whites.
Assemble the ingredients: put a bit of sauce
on the bottom of the pan. Then alternate 3
lasagna noodles, half of ricotta mixture
spread on noodles, sauce, a shake or two of
Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of mozarella
sliced. On top layer of noodles, spread re-
maining sauce and place mozarella slices in
decorative pattern.
Bake in a 9 1/2 x 13 x 2" pan, 325° for one hour.
Cover with aluminum foil for 3/4 hour; remove
foil last 1/4 hour.
The basic lasagna recipe was given to me
during my first year of marriage by the pro-
prietor of an Italian specialty store in North
Adams, Mass. I added the vegetables my-
self later. You can choose which vegetables
to use; emphasize only carrots one time, or
only zucchini, onion, pepper another. lf you
wish to limit salt intake, use fresh tomatoes
and make up the sauce with them. This rec-
ipe has fed many a Hashomer group. When
Naomi was in the Ken, we were known as
the "lasagna house."
Yield: 8-10 servings

DAVID EYRE'S PANCAKE
1/2 c. flour
1/2 c. milk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
pinch of nutmeg
4 T. butter (or margarine)
2 T. confectioner's sugar
juice of 1/2 lemon
Preheat oven to 425°. In bowl, combine flour,
milk, eggs and nutmeg. Beat lightly; leave
batter a little lumpy. Melt butter in 12" skillet
with heatproof handle. When very hot, pour
in batter. Bake in oven 15-20 minutes or until
pancake is golden brown. Sprinkle with
sugar and return briefly to oven. Remove
from oven and sprinkle with lemon juice.
This may be served with jam.
Yield: 2-4 servings

POTATO KUGEL
6 large raw potatoes
3 eggs
1/4 c. flour
1 small onion, grated
1/2 c. shortening (or
chicken fat)
1 t. baking powder
1 t. salt
dash of pepper
Grate the potatoes on a fine grater, drain off
most of the water and add the remaining in-
gredients. Mix well. Pour into a well greased,
heated pudding dish (or individual cupcake
tins) and bake at 400° for 1 hour or until a
brown crust has formed on top. Serve hot.
To make the pudding lighter in texture and
color, one large cooked and mashed potato
can be substituted for one of the raw
potatoes.
PROCESSOR POTATO KUGEL
1/4 c. oil
4 large potatoes,
peeled and cut in
chunks
1 large onion,
quartered
3 eggs
1 1/2 t. salt (or to taste)
1/4 t. pepper
1/4 c. flour or potato
starch
Put oil in 8" square or 7 x 11" glass casserole.
Preheat oven to 375°; put casserole in oven
and heat till oil is hot, about 5 minutes. Put
potatoes in processor with steel blade.
Grater could be used, but I like the texture
better with the steel knife. Process with sev-
eral on/off turns till mixture is textured, but
not liquidy. Transfer to a colander and let
cold water run to keep potatoes white.
Meanwhile process onion until minced. Add
eggs and seasonings. Process for a few
seconds. Press out water from potatoes and
pat with paper towel to dry. Put in large mix-
ing bowl with flour, other ingredients and 3
tablespoons of the hot oil. Mix this well. Pour
potato mixture into casserole and sprinkle
with a little more oil on top. Bake uncovered
at 375° for about 1 hour or until top is brown
and crispy.
I have doubled this recipe successfully,
using a 13 x 9" casserole. It may seem to
have too much oil when you pour batter in,
but this will be absorbed during baking.
Yield: 6-8 servings.

PICKLED LOX
2 onions
1/2 lb. lox (cut in thick
slices)
1/2 box mixed pickling
spices
1 c. vinegar
sweet cream to taste
sugar to taste
1/2 c. water
Soak lox in water to cover and add a little
milk; let soak 1 hour. Boil together the vin-
egar, water, and pickling spices. Strain this
mixture and add sugar to taste.
Drain lox and wash in cold water. Slice
onions and place slices in well-washed jar.
Add lox to the jar and pour half of the vinegar
solution over it. To the other half of the vin-
egar solution, add sweet cream and pour

PICKLED HERRING
2-3 large salt herring
(preferably "milter"
type)
2 c. water
1/2 c. white wine vinegar
1 t. mixed pickling
spices
a few bay leaves
sugar to taste
4 large onions, sliced
1 lemon, sliced
Soak herring overnight or 24 hours. Change
water as frequently as convenient. Skin her-
ring and cut into chunks. Make enough liq-
uid to cover the herrings by boiling water and
vinegar in the proportions given above, dou-
bling or tripling amounts if necessary. Add
pickling spices, sugar and bay leaves to
boiled mixture. Cool.
Place herring in sterilized jars and cover
with the liquid. Add the sliced onions and
lemon slices to each jar. Cover tightly and
place in refrigerator. Let stand 3-4 days be-
fore eating. Will keep 1-2 weeks.
If milter (male) herring is used, remove the
white organs from inside the herring (the
milt) and mash through a strainer and add
to the vinegar and water mixture. This will
make the liquid a creamy white and add ex-
cellent flavor.

with butter. Put under the broiler and leave
until both onions and potatoes are nicely
browned; turn ingredients so both sides
brown. Remove from broiler and place the
mackerel, which has been split in half and fil-
leted, on top of the potatoes and onions, skin
side down. Season fish lightly with salt and
pepper and sprinkle generously with pa-
prika. Dot with butter. Place under broiler
again until surface of fish is well browned.
Remove from broiler, pour cream over ingre-
dients, and place in a 350° oven for 1/2-3/4
hour, or until potatoes are tender and gravy
is thick. If necessary during baking time, the
milk can be added to prevent the fish from
becoming too dry.

MOTHER'S ROAST CHICKEN
4 lb. chicken, cut up
salt and pepper
paprika
garlic salt
3 onions, cut up
1 bay leaf
ketchup
Season chicken with salt, pepper, paprika
and a bit of garlic salt.
Arrange in a blue granite roaster. On top add
cut up onions and a bay leaf. Roast covered
for 1/2-3/4 hour at 350° until a gravy forms. Re-
move chicken from pan. Add to the gravy
enough ketchup to make a rich brown
sauce; you may need a little water. Remove
from roaster. Arrange chicken 1 layer deep,
spooning a little gravy over each piece. You
may have to roast this twice if you have too
much chicken. Roast uncovered at 425° until
it looks a tasty dark reddish-brown, 10-15
minutes. Remove roaster. Turn oven down to
300°; cook till tender.

LEMON ROAST CHICKEN
1 roasting chicken,
4-5 lbs., or capon
salt and pepper
3-4 lemons
6 sprigs fresh thyme
Wash chicken and pat dry. Sprinkle inside
and out with salt and pepper. Put thyme
sprigs inside cavity. Pierce lemons with a
fork. Make sure lemons are well pierced.
Stuff inside the cavity. Don't be afraid to
push them in. Truss chicken tightly, being
careful not to bruise the breast meat. Roast
at 425° for about 30 minutes. Test by prick-
ing the meaty part of the leg; the juices
should run clear, not pink. The oil from the
lemon will make the chicken deliciously
fragrant!

"DONOR" CHICKEN
6-8 pieces frying chicken
seasoned salt to taste
1/2 c. vegetable oil
(approx.)
krispie rice cereal
(approx. 2 c. after
grinding)
Season chicken generously with seasoned
salt. Dip quickly into oil and let excess drain
back into bowl. Dredge in rice cereal. Bake
at 350° in shallow pan for 1 hour or until
done.
This recipe was served at many Donor
luncheons and Shabbat dinners in my
hometown synagogue when I was growing
up. Many years later when I was in charge
of Shabbat dinners at Beth Israel Con-
gregation in Ann Arbor, I used this recipe
because it is so easy to prepare for a crowd.
I have received many compliments and
many requests for it. Try it and see what a
difference the rice cereal makes. This is
also good on miniature "drumettes"
(chicken wings) served as an appetizer
with sweet and sour sauce.

and onion mixture to bowl. Add wine and
water to eggs and pour into big bowl. Mix all
ingredients together with hands. Add a little
more wine if stuffing seems too dry. Put into

fully cooked. During baking of separate
stuffing, baste top of casserole twice with
drippings from turkey pan as bird roasts. (If
one prefers not to do this because of the
cholesterol, add a little more margarine to
the celery and onion when sautéing.)

Hada860057.txt
Tcholent, called "shalet" in some regions, is a meal-in-one dish,
designed to meet the need for a hot food on the Sabbath, when
cooking is prohibited. The origin of this dish is unknown. There is a
theory that the word tcholent may have originated in France from
the word <I>chaud</I>, meaning hot. Another theory is that it might have
had its origin in the two German words, <I>shule ende</I> (end of syna-
gogue services), and was corrupted in sound to the current term,
tcholent.
There are several varieties of tcholent, depending on regional
differences. It may be composed of very inexpensive ingredients,
or include as lavish contents as the budget permits. Vegetables
other than those specifically mentioned in the recipe may be
added. Regardless of the ingredients, it is the method of prepara-
tion, the slow cooking or baking, that gives tcholent its character.
TCHOLENT
2 large onions, diced
2 T. chicken fat
1/2 lb. dried lima beans
(soaked in cold
water until tender)
8-10 medium potatoes,
quartered
2 lbs. beef (brisket,
short ribs or chuck)
2 T. flour
salt, pepper, paprika
to taste
boiling water to cover
Sauté onions in hot fat in the bottom of a
Dutch oven or any other heavy iron pot with a
tight fitting lid. When onions are brown, add
the beans, potatoes and place meat in the
center. Mix flour and seasonings and sprin-
kle over top. Add boiling water to cover.
Close lid and cook over low heat for 3-4
hours. Lift cover to make sure no additional
water is needed; cover and place in a 375°
oven for 1/2 hour. Lower heat to 225° and al-
low to stay all day or overnight. Keep cov-
ered tightly, no basting, and no peeping! The
pot may be given an occasional shake or
two before being placed in the oven. The
tcholent can also be cooked on the top of the
stove. After the first 3-4 hours, place the pot
on an asbestos pad over a simmer flame.
The flame should be as low as possible with-
out the danger of it extinguishing during the
night. Let the pot sit on the stove until ready
to serve.
BRISKET
1 brisket of beef
6 onions, cut up or
sliced (you may use
more, if you wish)
Place half the onions on the bottom of the
roasting pan. Place brisket on top of onions.
Cover the meat with the rest of the onions.
Cover pan tightly, using foil if necessary for a
tight cover. Bake in a slow oven, 275° for at
least 2 hours. Test with fork for tenderness.
Recover tightly if more cooking is needed.
Usually there is enough juice from the meat;
if not, add hot water to keep meat from
burning.
Cook this 1 day in advance and refrigerate to
let the fat congeal. Next day, remove the fat
from the surface. Meat can now be sliced,
reheated or frozen. Leftovers are great for
sandwiches.

pe almost every week for as long as I can

BRISKET OF BEEF
1 brisket of beef
salt, garlic salt,
pepper to taste
3-6 onions, sliced
bay leaf
Brown the brisket in a preheated Dutch oven
on the top of the stove. Add onions and bay
leaf. Bake at 350°, covered, till almost
tender, but not quite, about 3 hours. Drain off
and reserve the gravy, and let the brisket get
cold. This is best if made 1-2 days before
serving. Slice meat, return gravy to pan and
reheat. It freezes magnificently.

<I>(Ed. Note: You may continue cooking after
browning on top of the stove. Cover and turn
down heat. Add carrots, potatoes or other
vegetables and cook 3 hours or more till
tender.)</I>

BLINTZES
BATTER:
4 eggs
1 c. milk
1/2 c. flour
1 t. vanilla
salt
1/8 lb. melted butter
FILLING:
2 1/2 lb. farmer cheese
1 lb. cream cheese
2 eggs
sugar to taste
raisins
Blend all ingredients for batter. Pour only
small amount of melted butter into 6" frying
pan (just enough to coat bottom). Pour in
batter, just enough to cover bottom of the
pan. If batter does not adhere to pan, pan is
too cold; if batter bubbles, pan is too hot.
When edges curl and look dry, flip blintze
onto a dish towel (not terry) or wax paper to
cool.
Mix all filling ingredients together in a bowl.
Place a tablespoonful in center of each
blintze, and fold the dough like an envelope.
Place seam side down in buttered frying pan
and sauté until brown on both sides.
Blintzes may be frozen. To reheat, place in a
single layer in a greased glass dish, dot with
butter and bake at 350° for 20-30 minutes.
<I>Filling Variations: You may use 1 pint of blue-
berries (washed and well drained), or pitted
cherries, or crushed pineapple, or apples
with walnuts and cinnamon.</I>

This recipe was reputed to be "knish-like";
some feel it resembles a "blintz-souffle".
"Blinish"? "Not-a-knish"? My mother-in-

would like it, she sent me the recipe, which I
modified. Hadassah Study Group enjoyed
it at the pot-luck end-of-year brunch.

CHALLAH
1/2 c. warm water
2 pkgs. dry yeast (or
fresh yeast)
1/2 c. oil
2 T. sugar
1 T. salt
1 1/2 c. boiling water
3 eggs, 1 yolk reserved
7 c. flour, or more
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Mix oil, salt,
sugar and boiling water in large bowl; cool to
lukewarm. Beat eggs into yeast, then add to
other mixture. Add 4 cups flour and beat well
with a wooden spoon or dough hook of elec-
tric mixer. Stir in enough additional flour to
make a firm dough that cleans the bowl.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Put in oiled
large bowl and turn to grease the top of the
dough. Cover tightly with a sheet of plastic
wrap and let rise 1 hour, until doubled.
Punch down and divide into 3 parts. Divide
each part into 4, taking 1 section for top and
dividing it by 3, so for each bread there are 3
pieces to braid for bottom and 3 small pieces
to braid for top. Roll each piece into a snake
and braid them together. Put large braid on
bottom; place smaller on top. Pinch sides to
adhere 2 braids.
Grease a baking pan. Place challah on pan,
brush with egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water.
Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds. Set
aside for 35 minutes to double. Bake in 375°
oven for approximately 30 minutes (or 15
minutes at 425°), then 15 minutes at 350°.

RYE BREAD
2 c. lukewarm water
1/2 oz. dry yeast (2 pkgs.)
2 T. sugar
1 1/2-2 c. rye flour (or more if
necessary) (Do not
use stone ground
flour, the texture is
too coarse.)
1 T. salt
4 c. white flour
3 T. caraway seeds
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup water; add remain-
ing water, sugar, salt, white flour and cara-
way seed. Stir for 1-2 minutes with a heavy
spoon until creamy. Cover with a damp cloth
and let stand 3-4 hours in a warm place.
(Sponge will be very sticky.) Stir in enough
rye flour to make a firm dough and knead
about 5 minutes. Put in lightly oiled bowl.
Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a
warm place until doubled (about 50 min-
utes). Punch down and knead for 3 minutes,
adding enough rye flour to make a firm
dough which will hold its shape. Divide in 2;
shape into 2 loaves. Put loaves on baking
sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Let rise un-
covered in a warm place until less than dou-
bled (about 50 minutes). Heat oven to 425°;
put a shallow pan of hot water on lowest
rack. Brush loaves with salt water (1 tea-
spoon salt dissolved in 1/4 cup water), and if
you like, slash each loaf 3 or 4 times diago-
nally. After 20 minutes, remove pan of water
from oven and brush again with salt water.
Continue baking until done (50 minutes to 1
hour). Remove bread to racks to cool; brush
again with salt water.
<I>If you like kimmel rye, when you shape the
loaves, knead into each loaf 1 teaspoon of
kimmel.</I>

REFRIGERATOR YEAST DOUGH
2 c. boiling water
1/2 c. sugar
1 T. salt
1/3 c. oil (or pareve
margarine)
2 T. dry yeast (2 pkgs.)
1 t. sugar
1/3 c. warm water
3 eggs
8 c. flour
1 egg, beaten
poppy seeds (or
sesame seeds)
In a large bowl combine: boiling water, sugar,
salt, oil (first 4 ingredients). In a 2 cup meas-
ure, combine dry yeast, sugar and warm
water (slightly warmer than a baby's bottle).
Let this mixture bubble up (this is called
"proofing".)
In a glass or cup, break eggs, individually,
checking for blood spots. Transfer one at a
time to small bowl; beat slightly. Add eggs
and yeast to cooled mixture in large bowl.
Beat in 4 cups flour (I usually use bread flour,
but all-purpose flour is satisfactory) using a
wooden spoon. Beat in 3 additional cups
flour; finally knead in approximately 1 cup
more flour. (Yes, total is about 8 cups!) If you
use a big enough bowl, you can knead in the
bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Re-
frigerate until double in size, at least 3 hours;
best if left overnight. "Punch down" and
knead. Braid into loaves. Place on greased
baking sheet and let rise 1 -1 1/2 hours for chal-
lah. Brush tops with beaten egg and sprinkle
with poppy or sesame seeds, if desired.
Bake in 350° oven for about 35 minutes, until
nicely browned. Cool on rack.

MOTHER'S BROWN BREAD
9 c. lukewarm water
1 1/2 T. dry yeast
4 1/2 c. whole wheat flour
(preferably a coarse
variety)
9 c. rye flour
3 T. salt
3 T. dark molasses
4 1/2 c. white flour
Put water into a large roasting pan; the
dough rises a lot. Add yeast and stir until dis-
solved. Add the whole wheat flour and half of
the rye flour. Stir well, cover and leave on the
counter for about 15 hours (a bit more or less
will not hurt.) Next, add salt and molasses
and mix well; add the remainder of the flour.
This gets stiff and must be mixed in very
well. Let it sit about 4 hours. This will rise a
great deal, forming a loose sticky sponge.
Flour a pastry cloth very well with white flour,
leaving some excess of flour on it. Prepare 6
bread pans, using a spray or grease well.
Pre-heat oven to 425°. Scoop up enough
dough to half fill a bread pan and put on
floured cloth, turning to coat with the flour so
it can be worked. (The stickiness will be con-
tained once it is coated with flour.) Knead
enough to form into a nice loaf and put in
pan. Continue with the rest of the pans.
When they are all done, wet your hand, and
with it, wet the tops of the loaves and press
into the corners of the pans a bit. Let sit 10
minutes, then bake 1 1/4 hours. Take out of
pans and put on racks to cool.
<I>Loaves freeze very well. Recipe can easily
be halved.
When I growing up in a little Upper Penin-
sula town, there was only a small Jewish
community and none of the conveniences
which families now have for keeping
kosher. Our meat came 250 miles by train
from Milwaukee and Jewish rye bread was
only an occasional treat, when my father
made a rare trip to Chicago. Most of the
Jewish families made all their own bread to
make sure no dairy products were in the
bread. Besides, it was much better than the
local store-bought variety. My mother made
brown bread and white bread, plus bagels,
onion rolls and even kaiser rolls every week,
but the brown bread is right at home in the
new "natural foods" environment of today.</I>

BAGELS
5 c. flour
1 cake yeast
1 c. warm water
2 T. sugar
2 t. salt
3 T. shortening
2 eggs, beaten
poppy seeds
(optional)
Place flour in a large bowl. Dissolve
crumbled yeast in water and add sugar.
Make a well in the flour and add the salt and
shortening. When yeast begins to rise on top
of water and looks bubbly and soft, pour mix-
ture into the well in the flour. Add beaten
eggs to well and mix batter from center out-
ward until thoroughly blended. When stiff,
knead with hands in the bowl. If necessary,
more water can be added at this point to ab-
sorb the flour. Cover bowl with a towel and let
rise a couple of hours until double in bulk.
Then punch dough down by kneading
again. Let rise a second time, approximately
1 hour.
Cut off pieces of dough and roll with hands
on a lightly floured board, until you have a
strip 10-12" long and 1/2-3/4" in diameter. Join
edges of strip to make a large ring. Repeat
until dough is used up. This should make ap-
proximately 2 dozen bagels.
Heat oven to 400° and grease the wire racks.
Place 3 rings at a time into rapidly boiling
water for 1-2 minutes. Sprinkle with poppy
seeds, if desired, as bagels rise to surface of
water. Remove bagels from water, (they
should be stiff enough to lift out with a fork.)
Place on racks in oven as quickly as possi-
ble to avoid excess rising. Bake for 15-20
minutes until first side is golden brown. Re-
duce oven to 350° and turn bagels; bake
10-15 minutes longer until second side is
brown.
<I>This recipe makes a soft "egg" type bagel.
It is not as hard and dense as the typical
"water" type bagel.</I>

BREAKFAST BRIOCHE
2 pkgs. dry granular
yeast
1 t. sugar
1/2 c. lukewarm milk
7 c. all-purpose flour
1/3 c. sugar
2 t. salt
1 t. lemon zest
2 eggs + 1 egg white,
slightly beaten
5 T. unsalted
margarine, melted
1 1/2 c. lukewarm milk
1 egg yolk + 1 t. water
In a small bowl mix yeast with sugar and
milk; stir to dissolve. Leave in warm place for
10-12 minutes to activate yeast. In a large
mixing bowl, put flour, sugar and salt; add
lemon zest. Make a well; add eggs, mar-
garine, milk and yeast mixture. First use a
wooden spoon for working liquids into flour.
Knead by hand or with kneading hook (in an
electric mixer) until dough is smooth and
elastic. (By hand it will take from 10-14 min-
utes.) If dough is too sticky, add up to 3 table-
spoons flour. Grease bowl turning dough
around. Cover with plastic wrap and towel.
Let rise in warm place (70-80°) for 1 hour or
until it doubles in bulk.
Place dough on lightly floured board. Knead
for 1 minute. Cut dough into 21 (30) pieces.
Take 1 piece of dough, cut into 3 pieces. Roll
each piece to 8" long strands and braid the
three strands (like braiding a child's hair).
Holding one end of the braided piece flat on
the board, twist the rest into a circle and tuck
the other end in. Repeat the procedure with
the rest of the dough. Grease 2 large bak-
ing pans or cookie sheets. Place braided
brioches on them. Return to warm place and
let them rise for 30-45 minutes.
Beat egg yolk with water, and with a pastry
brush paint brioches on sides and tops. (If 1
egg yolk is not enough, add another to mix-
ture). Bake for 20-25 minutes at 375° (or until
golden).
This recipe freezes well. Reheat before
serving at 300° for 8-12 minutes.
Yield: 21 3-oz. (or 30 2-oz.) brioches

HAMANTASHEN COOKIE DOUGH
DOUGH:
1/2 c. butter
1 c. sugar
1 egg
2 c. flour
2 t. baking powder
2 T. milk
vanilla or lemon
flavoring
FILLING #1:
1 egg
1/4 C. sugar
1/4 lb. poppy seeds
FILLING #2:
1 c. poppy seeds
2 t. butter
1/2 c. chopped nuts
1/2 c. raisins
2 T. corn syrup
1 c. milk
1 T. chopped citron
1 t. vanilla
FILLING #3:
grated rind of 1 lemon
2 T. lemon juice
1/2 lb. prunes
Cream together the butter and sugar, and
add the egg. Mix and sift flour and baking
powder, and add a little of this mixture to the
creamed butter and sugar. Add the milk. Add
remaining flour mixture. Add flavoring ex-
tract. Roll dough out; cut into rounds; fill with
a spoonful of filling; form into triangles. Bake
at 375° for 15-30 minutes until delicately
browned.
Any sweet yeast cake dough can be used
for hamantashen. Some people prefer an
unsweetened challah dough. When using
yeast dough, roll as thin as possible, shape
and fill, and then allow cakes to stand a
while to rise before baking. Use oven tem-
perature recommended for the type of
dough used. Bake until lightly browned.
Filling #1: Pour boiling water over poppy
seeds, let stand until seeds have settled at
bottom, and drain. Put seeds through finest
blade of food chopper. Add egg, stirring it in
well, add sugar, and mix thoroughly.
Filling #2: Put poppy seeds through finest
blade of the food chopper, and mix with re-
maining ingredients, except vanilla. Let mix-
ture cook over slow fire until thick, stirring
often. Let cool and add vanilla.
Filling #3: Soak prunes over night. Cook in
water in which they were soaked until soft.
Drain well. Remove stones from prunes and
cut into small pieces. Mix with grated rind
and juice of lemon.

GRANDMA ROSE GLICKSBERG'S
HAMANTASHEN
DOUGH:
1 c. butter
2 c. sugar
4 eggs
1 T. vanilla
juice of 1/2 lemon
4 c. flour
1 T. baking powder
1 t. salt
4 hard cooked egg
yolks, mashed fine
FILLING:
12-16 oz. pitted prunes
(check for pits!)
1/2 box apricots
1 c. almonds (or wal-
nuts), chopped
1/2 box raisins
1/8 c. lemon juice
1/2 c. orange juice
1/2 t. almond extract
1/4 t. cinnamon
1 c. plum (and/or apricot
preserves)
GLAZE:
egg yolk
1 T. water
Cream the butter with the sugar. Add the
eggs, vanilla, lemon juice. Mix well. Add the
flour, baking powder and salt; then the
mashed egg yolks. Add more flour if neces-
sary until dough is no longer sticky. Chill.
For filling, grind (or use a food processor) to
blend the first 4 ingredients. Add the rest of
the ingredients to taste. The filling should be
moist and light.
Roll dough out on floured surface. Cut into
2 1/2-3" circles. Put 1 teaspoon filling on each
circle. Pick up the edges toward the center
to form a triangle and pinch together with
floured fingers. Glaze tops with a mixture of
egg yolk and water. Bake on a cookie sheet
at 350° for 15 minutes.
This was my grandmother's hamantashen
recipe. Every year my daughters (and oc-
casionally friends) join me in perfecting the
flavor. We enjoy the assembly line produc-
tion by rotating tasks. Rarely do we come
out even between the dough and filling, but
that adds to the fun and challenge. We hope
others will like this recipe too.
Yield: makes 4-5 dozen

2 c. butter
3 c. flour
FILLING:
1 lb. pitted prunes
1/2 lb. currants
1/2 lb. raisins
1 lb. sugar
1 c. water
Boil filling ingredients to a thick and heavy
mass; cool completely. Cream sugar and
butter till smooth. Add flour and beat till well
blended. Roll out on floured board; cut into
circles (any preferred size). Put 1 tablespoon
filling in the center of the circle of dough.

A Jewish passenger on the S.S. Rotterdam
cruise through the Panama Canal remem-
bered that Purim would be celebrated dur-
ing the cruise. She decided to ask the chief
baker (who was Spanish) to bake some ha-
mantashen, giving him the above recipe
and a tip of $100. He followed her instruc-
tions-the results were delicious. She was
so pleased that she gave him another $100!
After that Purim, which fell on a Friday, he
baked hamantashen every Friday for the
rest of the cruise.
Yield: makes about 2 dozen large or
more, depending on the size preferred.

1 pkg. yeast (scant 1 T.)
1/4 c. warm water
3 T. sugar
3 heaping c. flour
(about 4 1/2 c.)
1 lb. margarine
3 T. sour cream
3 egg yolks
cinnamon, sugar mix
(about 1/3 c.)
ground walnuts
raisins (optional)
1 egg, beaten

bine flour and margarine. Add sour cream,
egg yolks, and yeast; mix. Transfer mixture
to a floured board and gently knead in
enough extra flour to handle. Form into a
ball. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Re-
move dough from refrigerator 2 hours before
needed. Cut into quarters. Roll out on
floured board until about 1/4-1/8" thick. Invert 9"
pie pan over dough and cut around edge
with a knife. Remove excess and save.
Sprinkle dough with cinnamon, sugar, nuts

beaten egg. Let rise 15 minutes. Bake at
325° until brown (about 30-45 minutes).
This recipe came from my husband's
grandmother, Ada Legator. I asked her to
show me how to make the delicious "horns"
everyone loved. The amounts of sour cream
and flour are approximate since she used
heaping spoons and cups to measure.

2 t. baking powder
1 c. sugar
3 eggs
3/4 c. oil
2 t. vanilla
1 c. chopped almonds
1/2 c. chocolate chips
cinnamon, sugar
Combine all the dry ingredients. Make a hole
in the middle and add the eggs, oil and va-
nilla. Mix by hand, until well blended. (This
mixture is too thick to use a mixer.) Stir in the
chocolate chips and nuts. Divide the mixture
into 4 parts and pat each into a loaf shape
about 2" wide by 16" long on an ungreased
cookie sheet. Bake at 350° for 25 minutes.

PINEAPPLE-JUICE-DOUGH
POPPY SEED PASTRY
DOUGH:
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. pineapple juice
2 eggs
1/2 c. salad oil
1 1/2 t. baking powder
1/2 t. salt
about 4 c. flour
FILLING:
2 cans poppy seed
filling
walnut meats,
chopped
raisins
coconut
Combine sugar and juice and bring just to a
boil. Cool. Add rest of dough ingredients,
using enough flour to make soft dough that
can be rolled. Take 1/3 of dough and on
floured pastry cloth, roll out rectangle about
6" wide and the length of your cookie tin on
which 3 long rolls are to be baked. Dough
can be cut and "patched" easily.
About in the middle in a narrow line or else in
2 narrow lines nearer to each edge, spoon
on poppy seed filling, using almost 3/4 of a
can for each of the 3 rectangles of dough to
be ultimately filled. Sprinkle chopped nuts,
raisins and coconut all along over filling.
Carefully roll dough tightly over filling and
pinch ends closed. If any holes appear, pa-
tch with small piece of rolled-out dough and
water at edges. Transfer to cookie sheet,
putting seam on bottom. When all 3 rolls are
on cookie sheet, bake at 350° until light
brown. Cool somewhat, but while still warm,
cut into slices.
This dough was my mother's treasured rec-
ipe; it's like a cookie dough.

Mix dough ingredients and knead gently.
Chill slightly, cut in 4 portions. On a lightly
floured surface, roll a portion at a time into a
very thin rectangle shape. Combine the
spread ingredients and spread 1/4 of the mix-
ture over the dough. Roll up from the long
side (like a jelly roll or shtrudel). Cut at an an-
gle in 1" slices. Spread with melted butter
and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mix-
ture. Bake on greased floured cookie sheet
(slices should be standing upright) at 350°
for 20-25 minutes until slightly brown.
Number of slices will depend on how large or
small the slices are cut, 1-2" suggested.
This recipe is a cross between a cookie and
a shtrudel slice. My mother's mother made
this each year for Succoth. My mother de-
veloped the recipe amounts after several
years of trial and tasting. She has made it
each year for 50 years. Now I have begun
making it.

TAIGLACH
8 eggs
4 1/2 c. flour
2 t. baking powder
1 lb. honey
1 c. sugar
1 t. ginger
1/2 c. walnuts (cut up)
Mix eggs, flour and baking powder thor-

shallow broad-bottomed pan, boil the honey,
ginger and sugar. Put particles of raw dough
into boiling syrup. Then place pan immedi-
ately into the oven. Do not open for first
15-20 minutes. By this time the honey will
have coated each piece of dough. Now, stir
every 10 minutes to prevent particles from
sticking to each other. Bake for 1 hour. The
pieces should be brown and when tested in
cold water should remain firm and crisp.
Pour onto moistened board, flatten, sprinkle
nuts on top and cut into squares. Will keep
indefinitely.

MRS. INGBER'S APPLE CAKE OR TORTE
DOUGH:
1 c. sugar
1/2 c. shortening or
butter
2 eggs
1/4 t. salt
1 c. liquid (juice of 1
lemon and 1
orange)
4 c. flour
2 t. baking powder
FILLING:
5-6 large tart cooking
apples, unpeeled
juice of 1/2 lemon
3/4-1 c. sugar to taste
1 t. cinnamon
Cream sugar and shortening well. Add eggs
and beat thoroughly. Mix dry ingredients and
add to batter alternately with the liquid, mix-
ing thoroughly. Roll approximately half the
dough on a floured board to 1/4" thickness.
Place in greased 9 x 13 x 2" pan and spread
the dough so it lines the bottom and sides of
pan. (A larger pan can be used if desired.
The recipe will make one 9 x 13 x 2" cake
with a little dough left over for cookies. Half
the recipe will fill an 8 x 8 x 2" pan.)
To make filling, remove core from the apples
and, without peeling, grate them on a very
coarse grater; sprinkle with lemon juice and
add sugar to taste. Amount will depend on
the natural sweetness of the apples. Add
cinnamon and mix well. Spread filling evenly
over dough in pan. Sprinkle the top lightly
with sugar cinnamon mixture.
Roll other half of dough to 1/4" thickness.
Place on top of layer of apples and pinch it
against the sides of the pan to seal over fill-
ing. Sprinkle surface lightly with a few drops
of water, then rather generously with the
sugar and cinnamon mixture. Mark off
squares by cutting through the top layer of
dough, just to level of apples. Prick the cen-
ter of each square to allow steam to escape.
Bake at 350° for 40 minutes or until lightly
browned.
This dough can be kept in the refrigerator
for about 1 week and used as needed. It is
also good for little cookies made with a cut-
ter or rolled by hand, then dipped in sugar
cinnamon mixture or nuts.
HUNGARIAN APPLE CAKE OR TORTE
12 apples, pared and
sliced
1 c. sugar
1/2 lb. sweet butter
3 c. flour
1/4 t. salt
minute tapioca
1 egg
grated rind of 1 lemon
5 T. sour cream (when
making cookies, use
1/2 milk and 1/2 sour
cream)
extra sugar
apricot jam
cinnamon
walnuts, chopped
Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar over apples and let
stand while preparing dough. Crumble to-
gether the butter, flour, salt and 3 table-
spoons of sugar into a coarse mixture. Make
a well in the center and add the egg and
lemon rind; blend together. Add 4 table-
spoons of the sour cream and blend. Add
the rest of the sour cream, blending well.
Knead dough on a floured board until
smooth. Divide into 3 parts.
Roll out 1 part of dough on lightly floured
board. Place on bottom and partly up the
sides of a greased large cake pan. Prick the
dough with a fork. Sprinkle just enough min-
ute tapioca to cover dough. Sprinkle dough
with 1/8 cup sugar. Spread apples over and
sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and lightly with
cinnamon.
Roll out second part of dough quite thin and
cover apples. Trim off excess and prick with
fork. Spread with thick apricot jam. Roll out
third part of dough (not so thin) and cut into
long strips. Lay strips over top diagonally.
Stir an egg white lightly and brush over
strips. Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and a
little sugar. Bake 1 hour at 350°.
The forte is the Jewish counterpart of the
pie, with this difference: whereas in the pie,
the filling plays the most important part, in
the torte, the filling must share honors
equally with the crumbly cookie dough
crust that surrounds it. Like the pie, how-
ever, the torte may be filled with any kind of
fruit, and instead of a top layer of dough, a
lattice top may be used.

garine. Roll out remaining dough, cover the
apples and slit the top in several places.
Place a 2-3" wide strip of aluminum foil
around edge of pie to prevent deep brown-
ing. Bake at 425° for 1 hour until well
browned. Remove foil for the last 10 minutes
of baking.

BETTY BECKER'S SLIMMER'S CHEESE PIE
(Crustless)
2 extra-large eggs
2 c. cottage cheese (1% milkfat), creamed but not watery
1/2 c. sugar
2 T. flour
1 c. lemon yogurt (pour off water on top)
1 T. fresh lemon juice
1 t. pure vanilla extract (cinnamon for sprinkling on top of pie before baking)
Pre-heat oven 325°-350° and spray a 9"
deep-dish pie plate well with vegetable
spray. In blender place eggs and 1 cup of the
cottage cheese, blending till smooth; add
rest of cheese and sugar, blending again till
smooth. Add remaining ingredients and
blend just till thoroughly mixed. Pour into
greased pie plate and sprinkle nicely with
cinnamon. Place in pre-heated oven on mid-
dle rack and bake about 45 minutes, or till
puffed and browned at edges. Cool on rack,
then refrigerate.
Serve chilled but not cold. Cuts beautifully
and is smooth, light, and creamy. Delicious
plain or served with fruit (fresh or cooked
and thickened). You can also add 1/2 cup of
well-drained crushed canned pineapple to
batter before baking. (There should be at
least 1/2" of extra space in pie plate.) You can
adjust flavoring to taste and, if not counting
calories, use the higher milkfat cottage
cheese for a richer pie.
A special hint: for most efficient use of
lemon juice and rind, squeeze 1-2 lemon
halves in advance, place juice in small jar in
fridge and place lemon shells in small plas-
tic bag in freezer; so simple to grate when
needed, and juice keeps for a few days.

SHTRUDEL
1/2 lb. margarine (or butter)
2 1/2 c. sifted flour
1/4 c. sugar
1 c. sour cream
FILLING:
apricot jam (or "Solo" poppyseed filling)
vanilla wafers
chopped walnuts
powdered sugar
Cut butter into flour and sugar; add sour
cream and mix well. (The dough will be very
sticky. Add a little more flour if necessary, but
don't make the dough too stiff. Refrigeration
will make it easier to handle.) Refrigerate
overnight or for 2-3 hours.
Cut dough into quarters. Roll out on a
floured board into a rectangle as thin as you
can (1/8") and still be able to handle it. Spread
with apricot jam and sprinkle with crushed
vanilla wafers and chopped walnuts. Do not
put filling closer than 1" from the edges. Be-
gin to roll into a jelly roll shape. Start at a long
side, roll twice, fold in the side edges, then
continue to roll up. (This keeps the filling
from leaking out.) Place on a greased cookie
sheet, seam side down, and gently pat the
roll flat on top. It should be about 2 1/2 x 12"
long. Bake at 375° about 30-45 minutes or
until golden brown. Cool on rack, sprinkle
with powdered sugar. Cut into 1" slices.
Another optional filling is 1 can "Solo" pop-
pyseed filling mixed with 1 cup apricot jam.

APPLE SHTRUDEL
PASTRY:
3 c. flour
1/2 t. salt
1 egg
1/2 c. oil
1 t. vinegar
3/4 c. warm water
FILLING:
melted margarine
bread crumbs
cinnamon-sugar mixture
canned, prepared sliced apples or 3 lbs. Granny Smith apples
lemon juice (if needed)
raisins
chopped nuts
jam (or marmalade)
Mix all pastry ingredients together. Knead
for about 10 minutes. Let pastry rest for at
least 10 minutes before rolling out thin on a
floured cloth. Turn the cloth frequently when
turning it to roll out, so as not to break the
dough. Seal the ends so the apple does not
run out.
Brush the pastry with melted margarine.
Sprinkle first with the bread crumbs, then
cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top this with the
apple slices. Over this, sprinkle the raisins
and chopped nuts; dot with jam or
marmalade.
Roll up the pastry. Before baking, mark the
top to make slicing easier. Brush with more
melted margarine. Bake at 350° for about 45
minutes.
I used to use a plain pastry cloth and won-
dered why my dough was not as thin as my
grandmother's was. I used to see a pattern
on her dough when she rolled it out. Then I
realized that she used a tablecloth, and the
pattern of the flowers imprinted itself on the
dough, so she then knew it was thin
enough!
Yield: 4 rolls, about 10 slices per roll

AUNT LENA'S CHEESE CAKE
CRUST:
18 graham crackers
1/4 c. butter, melted
FILLING:
1 lb. farmer cheese
1 c. sugar
1/2 t. salt
1 can evaporated milk
(large)
1 t. vanilla
2 T. lemon juice
2 T. flour
4 eggs, separated
Break graham crackers into fine crumbs and
mix well with melted butter. Pat mixture onto
the bottom of an 8 x 12" pan to form an even
crust.
Mix all filling ingredients together except egg
whites. Beat well so mixture is smooth and
creamy. Beat egg whites until stiff; fold gen-
tly into cake mixture. Pour into crumb crust
and bake for 1 hour at 350°. Allow cake to
cool in oven with the door open. This pre-
vents excess falling in. However, the cake
will drop a little. Don't worry about it, as it is
unavoidable.
Eunice Cook
Ed. Note: This recipe is the only one Eunice
knows that is cheese cake with a Yiddishe
tam. It was given to her by an aunt who
demonstrated it for a Haddassah chapter.
The secret lies in the use of farmer cheese
which gives it its unique taste. The farmer
cheese is very easy to handle, blends
easily, is moist and not crumbly like cottage
cheese. It has a delicious flavor.

YEAST CAKE (Basic Sweet Dough Recipe)
2 cakes fresh or dry
yeast
2 c. lukewarm milk
1 c. sugar
2 t. salt
2 eggs, well-beaten
7-7 1/2 c. enriched flour
1/2 c. melted butter
Crumble yeast into mixing bowl. Stir in milk,
sugar and salt; let stand until yeast is dis-
solved. Stir in eggs. Add half the flour. Beat
until mixture drops from spoon in a steady
stream (about 5 minutes). Stir in melted but-
ter. Stir in remaining flour with hand, adding
just enough to make a soft dough. Mix well.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Round up.
Place in floured bowl. Cover with cloth. Let
rise in warm place. When double in bulk,
punch down and cover. Let rise again over-
night. Dough will be just right in morning for
coffee cakes or coffee rings.
Sprinkle flour on board. Flour your hands.
Place dough on flour. Spread dough oblong-
shaped to 1/2" thickness. Brush melted butter
(or margarine) on dough. Sprinkle on the fill-
ing (combination of chopped nuts, raisins,
sugar and cinnamon). Roll as for a jelly roll.
To make sweet rolls, slice dough to 3/4-1"
rounds and place in baking pan. Cover for 1
hour with dishtowel. Bake at 375° until nicely
browned. Baking time will depend upon bulk
of the rolls or loaves made.
To make coffee ring, follow above directions
until you have a "jelly roll"; cut it in half. Make
round circle with each half, pinching ends to
complete the circle. Put each in buttered
8-9" round cake pan. Slit top with diagonal
slices half way down. (Filling will come bub-
bling through slices when baked.) When
cool, top with white icing dripped over the
top.

ALMOND COFFEE CAKE & VARIATIONS
DOUGH:
3/4 c. warm water (total)
1 pkg. dry yeast
3 T. sugar
2 3/4 c. flour
3 T. dry milk powder
3 T. butter (or
margarine)
1 t. salt
1 egg, beaten
Combine 1/4 cup water, yeast and sugar. Stir
and let stand until it bubbles. Put flour, dry
milk, butter and salt into food processor; pro-
cess until combined. Add egg and yeast;
combine. Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup water
while the processor is running. Stop adding
water when mixture forms a ball. (I usually
have 1-2 tablespoons left in the cup.) Con-
tinue to mix about 10-15 seconds. Let rest for
2 minutes. Then turn on again for about 10
seconds. If dough is sticky, add flour 1 table-
spoon at a time to correct.
Turn onto floured surface. Form a ball. Place
in greased bowl, turning to coat all surfaces;
cover and let rise until doubled, about 1-1 1/2
hours. Punch down. (Press fist into center of
dough, it will deflate, pull away from sides.)
Turn dough onto board and reform into a
ball. Do not knead.
Variations:
Roll out on floured board into 12 x 18" rec-
tangle. Spread with Solo almond filling or
poppy seed filling or butter, cinnamon, sugar
and nuts. Sprinkle with chopped almonds or
walnuts. Roll up, starting along 18" edge.
After 2 rolls, fold in short edges to catch fill-
ing. Continue to roll, ending with seam side
down. Cut with serrated knife into 1" slices.
A. Place side by side in 9 x 11" pan to make
12 sweet rolls.
B. Place in greased angel food tube pan,
overlapping each slice.
C. Place in cupcake tins.
D. Place on greased cookie sheet, in cir-
cular shape overlapping each slice.
Leave hole in center.
Drizzle with melted butter, sprinkle with
more nuts if desired. Let rise until doubled.
Bake at 375° for 15 minutes (rolls) to 30 min-
utes (whole cake). Remove when light gold,
but not dry. Rolls should press in slightly
when touched on top. If they don't, they have
baked too long and will taste dry.

Hada860100.txt
Wine has played an important role in Jewish ceremony and
culture throughout the ages. In biblical times the use of wine was
obligatory both in public religious functions and for domestic cere-
monial occasions. The references to wine as a means of promot-
ing joy, as a sign of the bountiful gifts of providence, and as a token
of personal gratitude to the creator are numerous throughout the
Bible.
How highly wine is regarded in the Bible may be seen from the
fact that in a figurative sense Israel is called a vine. Later the rabbis
used wine as a metaphor not only to represent Israel but also the
Torah, the Messiah, and holy men. In the Talmud it is stated that in
the world to come the righteous will drink wine from the grapes
grown during the days of creation.
The greatest blessing in the conception of the Hebrew people,
the blessing of peace, is represented by the picture of a man rest-
ing under his vine and fig tree. Abundance of wine is in the Bible an
indication of prosperity, and to offer bread and wine to a guest is a
sign of friendship and hospitality.
The rabbis held that taken in moderation wine is not only a
healthful stimulant but is possessed of great curative properties,
the best of all medicines. However, drunkeness was strictly forbid-
den. It was the custom in Talmudic times to give ten cups of wine to
mourners with the "meal of consolation".
The use of wine has been continued at religious functions in the
synagogue and in the Jewish home on all festive occasions to this
very day.
CONCORD GRAPE WINE I
10 lbs. ripe grapes,
stemmed
5 lbs. sugar
Put grapes in an open crock and squeeze or
mash by using 2 smooth boards. Cover
crock with muslin and let stand at room tem-
perature for 1 week. Stir once or twice during
that period. Strain through muslin. Do not
squeeze the mashed grapes while straining.
Return wine to the crock and add the sugar,
dissolved with some of the grape juice.
Cover with muslin and let stand 7 days
longer at room temperature. Fill bottles with
wine, but do not cork tightly. Store away from
light for 1 month. Taste and add more dis-
solved sugar if desired. Store in a cool place
away from light. Will be ready for use in 3
months. Matures and increases in strength
rapidly after that initial period.
Yield: approximately 2-2 1/2 gallons
CONCORD GRAPE WINE II
10 lbs. ripe grapes,
stemmed
3 qts. boiling water
5 lbs. sugar
Put grapes in crock and pour in boiling water.
When cool enough to handle, squeeze with
hands without crushing seeds. The grapes
need not be mashed to a dry pulp. Cover
with muslin and let stand 3 days. Strain
through muslin, squeezing lightly. Add sugar
and stir. Cover and let stand 1 week. Uncover
and skim carefully. Strain again, bottle and
cork tightly. Lay bottle on side and store in a
cool place away from light. Ready for use in
2-3 months.
Yield: about 2 gallons

RAISIN WINE
2 lbs. light raisins
6 qts. cold water
1 lb. sugar
1 lemon, rind and juice
3 sticks cinnamon
(approx. 1 oz.)
Chop raisins and add other ingredients in
the order listed, using a large well covered
crock. Let stand covered at room tem-
perature for 1 week. Stir once a day to keep
mixture well under the cover. Fermentation
will make the liquid rise and bubble over if
not given at least 4" of space under the
cover. Strain at the end of the week. (A mus-
lin cloth placed in a large funnel over another
crock makes an excellent strainer.) Place
liquid in bottles, cover tightly and store in a
cool place away from light, at least 2 weeks
before using.
Yield: approximately 1 1/2 gallons
PEACH BRANDY
Clingstone peaches
3-4 c. sugar to each 2-qt.
jar
Use peaches when ripe, but not soft to the
pressure of finger tip. Pack peaches in 2-
quart glass jars with wide openings. Pour
proper amount of sugar into jars and adjust
covers loosely. Shake jars once a day for 1
week or until juice begins to form and all
sugar is dissolved. The juice should cover
the fruit by that time. Tighten lids and store in
a cool dark place for 3 months. The brandy
may be strained and bottled any time after
that. Yield depends on juiciness of the fruit.
CHERRY CORDIAL
6 lbs. large sweet
cherries
2 1/2 lbs. sugar
1/2 pt. brandy
1/2 qt. boiled water,
chilled
Stem, wash and drain cherries. Place in
crock and add sugar and brandy. Cover with
double fold of muslin. Keep at room tem-
perature. Stir each day for 4-5 days to dis-
solve the sugar completely. Cover tightly,
and let stand 2 weeks. Stir in water, cover
and store in cool place. Can be bottled after
6 weeks. The cherries drained from this cor-
dial may be used for preserves. They are de-
licious eaten just as is. Yield depends upon
juiciness of cherries.
HALINA'S CHERRY LIQUEUR
1 quart jar
sour cherries, to fill jar,
2/3 or 3/4 of capacity
1 c. sugar
vodka or grain neutral
spirits
Cherries should be freshly picked, not pit-
ted. Place cherries in quart jar, filling it to 2/3
or 3/4 full. Add sugar, pour vodka in until jar is
filled with liquid. Close jar tightly. Mark date
on it. Store in dark place for a minimum of 2
years, preferably longer.
My friend Rita Kaufman of Atlanta, Georgia
also had a grandmother in Europe. She re-
minded me of the recipe and urged me to
make it. I have, ever since.

PASSOVER
EASY ROSSEL (FOR HORSERADISH)
A few raw beets
1 jar of water
1 fresh horseradish root
water
To make rossel, a sour condiment used to
color and flavor horseradish and salad
dressings, place a few raw beets in a jar of
water. Cover the open jar with a thin piece of
cloth. Place this in a warm place for about 3
weeks. Peek at it every 2 or 3 days so you
can pick off any mold that may form. When
this sours, it is ready to use. Beets from
rossel are good in borscht.
And now for the horseradish. Select a fresh
root. Clean it and cut it into pieces. Shred
this with a bit of water in your blender. If you
did not make rossel, use a little salt and vin-
egar to make it tasty. If you made rossel, add
a little at a time until you like the color and it
suits your taste.

MATZO POTATO KUGEL
6 large Idaho potatoes,
raw
1/2 c. matzo meal
1 1/2 t. salt and a turn or 2
of fresh ground
pepper
6 eggs
3 T. chicken fat (or oil)
1 medium onion
Use a 3-quart oblong glass baking dish.
Peel potatoes and soak in ice water about 1/2
hour. Beat eggs until thick (about 15 min-
utes). Have eggs ready when you start to
grate potatoes. Also heat oven to 375°.
Grate potatoes into a large bowl using me-
dium grater. Do not use fine holes or your
pudding will be heavy. Grate quickly, using a
long stroke. Grate onion fine. Mix grated
vegetables, seasoning, eggs; add matzo
meal last. Melt chicken fat in baking dish in
oven. Pour potato mixture into hot dish.
Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until nice and
brown.
<I>You may prepare this early in the day and
bake your kugel for 1/2 an hour. Finish baking
when you are ready to serve. You may pre-
pare this ahead of time and cover with plas-
tic wrap, with the wrap touching the pud-
ding in the baking dish. The big problem
with potato kugel is that the potatoes turn
dark. One avoids this by mixing and baking
as soon as potatoes are grated.</I>
Mildred Carron
<I>Ed Note: by using the food processor to
grate potatoes, you can speed the grating
process and avoid potatoes browning.
Eggs may also be beaten in processor after
potatoes are poured into baking dish. Ex-
periment with processor to get desired po-
tato texture.</I>
