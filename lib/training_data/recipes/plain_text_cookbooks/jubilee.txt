NEVER GREASE THESE TINS.
As seen in out on first page, the sides and bottoms of these
tins can be taken apart, by first removing the three springs, cut
the cake loose from the side, then by inserting the point of a
knife in the groove at the bottom the side becomes loose and can
moved. Cut *** loose fr*** removed ***
it *** remain on the bottom until need
GENTLE HINTS.
The whites of eggs beat stiffer and much quicker when quite
cool; therefore keep them in the cellar until wanted for use.
The nature of salt is cooling and all cakes that are composed
large*** of the whites of eggs should have a good pinch of salt
added before beating.
Do not mix up a cake in a bowl that has just come out of
hot water; cool it with cold water. It will save you work in the
end.
The fresher the eggs the better the result in cake making.

PREFACE.
Whether people eat to live, or live to eat, still with its mystery, con-
fronts our thoughtful civilization. But we do not learn that tea has
been postponed to await the solution. The very latest developments as-
sure us that men will eat, and inasmuch as nothing contrary to this may
be discovered so late in the afternoon of our world's history, it becomes
the benefactors of our race to furnish such information as will present
the results of the best experience. Our modesty shall not interfere with
the assertion of the important truth, that the Jubilee Cook Book answers
the demand.
Gibbon tells us that among the Romans the inventor of a new sauce
was liberally rewarded, but if it did not prove palatable, the claimant
was restricted to that article until another was invented. The Commit-
tee accepts the conditions, so certain are its members that the recipes
will afford such satisfaction as must relieve the purchaser of any unwel-
come visitations.
We have heard that in other lands bad cooking has been a fruitful
source of domestic infelicity, first by producing painful disappointment,
where the delicious and agreeable was anticipated, and second from
those painful reminders which insist upon refreshing the patient's mem-
ory, in reference to the last meal. Even Dr. Ben Johnson had no im-
perial scepter that could " bid the sunshine smile " when he sat down
to his illy-cooked mutton. His stentorian rhetoric was peculiarly forci-
ble as the unfortunate servants received his imperial rebukes for their
bad cooking. But they were not to blame: They lived too soon. The
" Jubilee" had not dawned. Such exhibitions now would be unpar-
donable, inasmuch as every home may enjoy the experiences of the very
competent contributors to the Cook Book.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
                      (jubilee0022)
It may be objected that our hundreds of recipes will tend away from
that simplicity that for 500 years contributed to the dominion of Sparta
over Greece. Did not that state subsist upon a simple diet? Yes, but
we are desirous that the sword should be beaten into the plowshare, and
an important agency in the transformation is the Cook Book. Attila
never tasted bread. How far his habit may have influenced his scourge-
like nature, we may not tell, but his were not the qualities demanded by
our civilization. Therefore eat bread, and in order that it may disarm
war-like tendencies, get the recipes for its kneading, and raising, and
baking from the Cook Book.
Lamartine says the Arabs pushed to superstitious extremes their re-
spect for hospitality, and its principal symbol was salt. It need not be
feared that we are losing our appreciation of this very beautiful custom;
on the other hand, it will be ascertained that salt is an ingredient in
many articles of diet mentioned in the Cook Book. We propose to be in
advance of Lamartine's Ishmalites. They provided milk for their guests
because it was cheaper than water, but the Cook Book has not been influ-
enced by such parsimony, for where water was needed to render the diet
palatable, it has been recommended regardless of expense.
Trusting that our mission is in the interest of individual comfort, do-
mestic peace, and national progress, we submit the Jubilee Cook Book
for the patronage of an appreciative public.

BLE VESSEL, REQUIRING VERY LITTLE WATER—and in connection
with all these superior advantages it has many others. Salt, Sulphur,

TESTED RECIPES.
SOUP.
In making soup of any kind, certain rules are essential.
First the kettle should be thoroughly clean. The meat should
be put into cold water which should be heated gradually, and
allowed to simmer slowly for four or five hours, skimming fre-
quently. After the meat is taken out, let the soup stand until
quite cold, so that all the fat can be removed. Beef is the most
nutricious meat for soup, though other meats, fowls and fish can
be used. Vegetables, if used, should be sliced thin, rice noo-
dles or whatever thickening is used should be added last.
Crackers for soup are much nicer if set in a warm oven for
a few minutes before sending to the table.
Bread crumbs fried brown in butter and dropped into soup
just as it is sent to the table, is very nice for flavor.
BEEF SOUP STOCK.
Take a shank of beef and cut the meat in fine pieces.
Take out the marrow and put it with a small piece of butter
into a kettle, set it over the fire and when hot add the meat
and then cook until brown, then put in the bones and sufficient
hot water to cover it well, let it boil four hours, strain and set
away in a cool place. This will keep a week or longer and can
be used as the base for any vegetable soup.
BEEF SOUP.
Put into a kettle a soup bone, pour on cold water, add salt,
cover closely and boil slowly three or four hours, then remove
the meat from the kettle if you wish to use it, as the vegetables
spoil the taste of the meat, slice three or four onions and a few
small potatoes and other vegetables, if you like, and boil until
very soft, season to taste and serve hot. Good for cold days.
                                                 A. M. L.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                      (jubilee0061)
TURKEY SOUP.
Put all the bones and scraps of meat and bits of dressing
of the turkey into a kettle with enough water to cover them;
let boil one hour, add some celery chopped fine, when done
season to taste and strain.
                                                 MRS. C. H. W.
OYSTER SOUP.
One quart of oysters, one quart of water, drain the liquor
from the oysters through a colander. Put the liquor with the
water, let it boil and skim it if needed, add half a cup of butter,
salt and pepper to taste, and six crackers rolled fine, when it
begins to boil pour in the oysters, and when it boils again add
half a cup of sweet cream or rich milk. Let it scald a moment
then serve.
ANOTHER.—Put a quart of oysters into a quart of cold
water, when it comes to the boiling point, season as in the
above rule. The oysters will be very plump and tender, and
the soup rich.
                                                 MRS. W. W. W.
BOSTON SOUP.
Boil one quart of beans three hours, add one quart of to-
matoes and boil half an hour and strain through a colander.
Season with plenty of salt and pepper. Keep plenty of water
in the beans while boiling, to prevent burning. Stir often after
they begin to cook to pieces. Have the soup of the consistency
of cream, when done.
                                                 MRS. A. W. AMES.
TOMATO SOUP.
A cupful of tomatoes with pepper, salt and butter, let it
all cook twenty or thirty minutes, add a quart of sweet milk,
let it come to a boil, and serve hot.
CREAM OF SALMON.
For two quarts of soup remove the skin and bone from a
cupful of cold salmon, and rub it through a fine sieve with a
potato masher. After the fish is prepared, make a cream soup.
Put over the fire a sauce pan with two large tablespoons of
butter and two level spoons of flour, stir them together until
they form a smooth paste, then gradually stir in hot milk until
two quarts have been added, let it come to a boil, then put in
the salmon, let it boil up once, stirring constantly, season with
salt and pepper.

NOODLES FOR SOUP.
Beat two eggs, thicken them with flour about the same as
for pie crust, add a little salt and roll out as thin as possible
into sheets, place them where they will dry gradually. Before
becoming crisp fold them together several times and cut in very
narrow strips (the narrower the better) drop these into the
soup and let boil two or three minutes.

and put in half a teaspoonful of soda. Serve immediately.
WHITE SOUP.
Boil a veal bone three hours with turnips, celery, onions,
carrots, and whatever else you may have that is suitable, and
that will not turn it dark, strain and boil again. Just before
you serve it add a pint of cream or milk, with three eggs well
beaten. Remove from the fire and stir rapidly.

FISH
BOILED WHITE FISH.
Lay the fish open in a dripping pan with the back down,
nearly cover with water, add two tablespoons of salt to one
fish, cover tightly and simmer (not boil) half an hour. Dress
with gravy, butter and pepper and garnish with hard boiled
eggs sliced. For the sauce, use a piece of butter the size of an
egg, one tablespoonful of flour, half a pint of boiling water.
Boil a few minutes and add three hard boiled eggs sliced.
                                                 MRS. N. BOOTH.
SALMON LOAF.
A NICE DISH FOR TEA.---One can of salmon, four eggs well
beaten, four tablespoons of butter melted, half a cup of fine
bread crumbs, season with pepper, salt, mace and parsley.
Chop the fish and rub in the butter with the back of a silver
spoon until it is smooth. Beat the crumbs into the eggs and
add the seasoning. Put into a buttered pudding mold and
steam one hour.
SAUCE.
One cup of milk heated and thickened with one tablespoon
of corn starch, the liquor from the fish (if none, double the
quantity of butter), one large spoonful of butter, one raw egg,
one spoonful of any kind of catsup, a pinch of cayenne pepper,
and one of mace. Put the egg in last and very carefully boil
one minute. When the pudding is entirely cold, take from the
mold and pour the sauce over it. Slice it after it goes to the
table.
                                                 MRS. A. W. AMES.
TO FRY FISH.
If the fish is large open it down the back and remove the
back bone, cut the fish in pieces convenient for serving, salt
them and dip them in corn meal and fry half an hour in plenty
of hot fat. I prefer beef drippings with a little butter, to all
butter for frying fish.
                                                 MRS. W. C. STEVENS.

                      (jubilee0065)
TO BAKE FISH.
Thoroughly clean the fish, wipe it dry, then make a dress-
ing of stale bread or cracker crumbs seasoned with pepper,
salt, butter and an egg to make it adhere, use only enough
water to moisten the bread. Fill the fish with the dressing,
sew it up and wind a narrow strip of cloth about it to prevent
breaking. Dredge the fish with flour, put it in the baking-pan
and lay some lumps of butter on it, bake thoroughly in a
moderate oven, lay it on the platter and remove the strings and
send it to the table as hot as possible. Any fish of three or
more pounds is very good baked.
FISH TURBOT.
Steam a white fish until tender then remove the bones and
sprinkle with salt and pepper. For a dressing heat one pint of
milk and thicken with a quarter of a pound of flour, when cool
add two eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter a very little onion
parsley and thyme. Put in a baking dish alternate layers of
dressing and fish. . Cover with bread crumbs and bake half
an hour.
                                                 S. E. BAILEY.
ESCALOPED FISH.
Fresh fish (almost any kind) three pounds. Boil whole,
twenty minutes, with a little salt; remove bones. Take one
pint of thick cream, one pint of milk, four tablespoons of
flour, stirred in some of the cold milk, have the remainder of
the milk boiling and stir in the cold thickening; then add
cream, one cup of bread or cracker crumbs, season, salt, etc.,
put in bottom of dish layer of crumbs, then layer of fish, with
the thickening on top, alternate until both are used, having
last on the top the cracker crumbs. Bake one-half hour.
                                                 H. M. CLOUGH.
BOILED CODFISH WITH POTATOES.
Soak sufficient codfish for your meal in cold water, put the
potatoes in kettle to boil, when boiled ten minutes lay in the
fish with the potatoes. Make rich dressing with butter rubbed
smooth with flour and seasoned with salt and pepper. Pour on
boiling water to make the amount desired.
                                                 MRS. C. H.

STEWED CODFISH.
Select thick and white codfish, pick in not too fine pieces,
soak in cold water. When freshened put in stewpan with
water to cover, let cook slowly, but not boil, for half an hour,
then add milk thickened with flour sufficient to make quite
thick, let boil and serve. If desired stir in beaten eggs. A
nice breakfast dish with baked potatoes.
                                                 MRS. C. H. W.
CODFISH BALLS.
Pick the fish fine and freshen ; boil potatoes and mash them.
While the potatoes are hot mix the fish with them, using one-
third fish and two-thirds potatoes. Put in plenty of butter;
make into balls and fry in hot butter or lard.
SALT MACKEREL.
Wash the fish clean, cutting off the head, fins and tail.
Soak it in cold water over night, if the fish is small; if a large
one, twenty-four hours will be necessary. (Soaking it in hot
milk a short time before cooking removes the strong taste).
Wipe the fish dry, lay it on a gridiron, the skin side down, and
let it broil; or put it on a tin plate and bake fifteen minutes in
a quick oven. After removing it to the platter, spread butter
upon it.
It is a good plan to keep a tin especially for fish, as it is so
difficult to remove the odor from a vessel in which fish has been
cooked.

MEATS.
Much depends upon the selection of meat. The sirloin
and rib pieces are mostly used for beef roasts. For steak,
porter-house and sirloin are the choicest. Twenty minutes to
the pound is the rule for a roast of beef, most people prefering
it rare. Pork, veal and lamb must always be well done to be
palatable. Do not salt steak before or while it is cooking, as it
draws out the juices, especially in broiling, as they will be lost.
If the fact can be demonstrated to a cook, that tough meat can
be made tender by pouring a little vinegar on it twenty min-
utes before cooking, there is no reason why she should send a
tough steak to the table. That method of cooking is the most
wholesome which prepares food most perfectly for the process
of digestion. Broiled and roasted meat retains nearly all its
juices. It is best to confine them by coagulating the albumen.
This is done by exposing the cut surfaces at first to intense heat
and when both surfaces are brown, finish cooking the meat by
removing a little from the fire. Roasts may be seasoned after
the surface is well browned. Boiling is the more economical
way of cooking meat, especially if soup is to be made of the
liquor, but as the juices of meat will escape unless the albumen
of the cut surface is quickly coagulated, it is necessary to put
the meat into boiling water in order to preserve them, then boil
or simmer slowly. Tough steak is often made more tender by
cutting across in squares on both sides and pouring over it a
little vinegar, allowing it to stand about twenty minutes before
broiling. The flavor of a beef roast may be very much im-
proved by the juice of a lemon poured over it just before
baking.
ROAST BEEF.
Have the oven hot and do not put water in the pan, pepper
and salt it slightly, and moisten the meat with the juices and
fat that will soon be made in the pan. Let the oven cool a
little after the cut surfaces are browned.
                                                 MRS. B. DAY.

ROAST BEEF.

*** all the bones, sprinkle with salt and pepper,
*** of suet in the center and roll firmly, wind it
a few *** with a strong cord and tie, place in dripping
pan *** of water and one tablespoon of vinegar.
Have the oven not enough to sear the meat quickly. Baste and
turn often. For a roast of eight pounds one hour is sufficient
time to cook it providing the oven is hot enough, and it should
be. Follow these directions well and you will never have to
make the excuse, "Our butcher never sends us a good roast of
beef.

ROAST BEEF.
Rub the salt and pepper into the meat thoroughly and
dredge well with Hour to prevent the juices coming out. Put
in a very hot oven, without water, until seared over, when it
may have a slower fire.

YORKSHIRE PUDDING FOR ROAST BEEF.
Bake exactly as for ordinary roast for the table, then make
a pudding as follows: To every pint of milk take three eggs,
three cups of flour and a little salt, stir to a smooth batter and
pour into the pan under the meat, half an hour before it is done.
                                                 MRS. NELSON BOOTH.
TO ROAST MEAT.
Take beef or fresh pork, three to five pounds, and allow
two hours to cook. Wash, place in kettle, season well, pour
upon it cold water enough to partially cover. Turn it over oc-
casionally while boiling and when tender place the kettle upon
the lid, cover and let it roast in the kettle. Do not put too
much water on the meat as you cannot roast it down as soon as
it is tender. Mutton should be parboiled first, veal does not
need so much time.
                                                 MRS. O. F. WEBSTER.
YORKSHIRE DRESSING.
One pint of sweet milk, one cup of flour, one small tea-
spoonful of salt, three eggs. Beat the eggs, stir the flour into
the milk, add the eggs, then pour into the dripper with your
roast twenty minutes before taking from the oven. Very nice.

BEEF STEAK FRIED.
Take either porter house, tenderloin or sirloin steak, not
more than one inch thick. Remove the bone, cut it in pieces
convenient to turn. Put your frying-pan over the fire with
small pieces of fat from the steak, have the pan quite hot, now
put in your steak, cover and turn just as soon as it browns,
do most of the cooking on the second side; leaving it a few
minutes for those who like it rare, and longer for those who
like it well done. Have your platter hot and sprinkle it ***
little salt and pepper, remove it to the platter at once, sp*** a
little nice butter over it, sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it,
pour a little coffee into the pan and turn into the platter, but
not over the meat. Set on the grate in the oven a minute and

around it as tightly as possible several coils of strong cord.
Boil slowly six or seven hours, in a vessel large enough to sus-
pend it. If desired hot, cut the wrappings and serve. Save
the liquor in the pot and what remains from dinner replace in

two or three tablespoonsful of flour; mix smooth and stir into

flour and prepare as for baking-powder biscuit; beat an egg
very light, put in the center of the flour, and with milk or water
mix very quickly; roll and cut into biscuits; roll each one
lightly in flour and drop into the boiling kettle ; cover tightly,
leaving plenty of room to swell. Let them boil for thirty min-
utes <I>without uncovering.</I> Carefully watch the fire that it is not
too hot under the kettle, as they will scorch very quickly.
In making baking-powder biscuits, as well as crust for pot
pie, if you wish to mix with water always take half lard and
half butter, and be generous with it, but if you use milk a small
piece of butter alone does better.

into the frying pan to cook until tender, but not broken. Lay
them on the platter with the pork and serve them hot.

SCRAPPLE.
Take such parts pork as are generally used for "head-
cheese," boil until the meat falls from the bone, keeping well
covered with water. Strain out the liquor and return it to the
kettle. If very greasy skim well. Then make a mush, by stir-
ring corn meal into this liquor, cooking for one hour and a half.
While the mush is cooking, chop the meat fine (bits of rind are
a nice addition) and stir as evenly as possible into the mush.
Salt and pepper highly. Let all boil up once, and take out into
<I>square</I> pans. When cold it is to be sliced and fried, the same
as sausage meat. It is a delightful breakfast dish.

POULTRY.
ROAST TURKEY AND CHICKEN.
Clean, wash, and then wipe dry. Fill with dressing of
moistened bread crumbs, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt and
sage, or summer savory if preferred, then sew up and truss.
Put in a roasting-pan with water, in which is a large piece of but-
ter, or what is better, very thin slices of salt fat pork. Chop
the giblets fine, to add to the gravy. When the fowl is done
remove to a platter, and thicken the gravy with flour made smooth
with water. Cook fowl until tender and of a rich brown color.
Use cranberry sauce and currant jelly with fowls, veal,
ham and game; capers or nasturtiums with mutton ; mint sauce
with roasted lamb; pickles with fish.

FRIED CHICKEN.
Cut your chicken in pieces, if very young just in half; see
that it is well cleaned ; wipe it dry. Beat up two eggs; have a
plate of flour; dip each piece first in the flour, then in the egg;
season with salt and pepper. Have hissing hot lard in your
skillet; put in the chicken; when brown on one side, turn it,
brown the other; place upon the platter; mix a tablespoon of
flour smoothly into a cup of sweet milk. Put a piece of butter
half the size of an egg into the skillet, pour in the flour mixture,
stir; and let come to a boil. Pour it over the chicken. I fry
veal cutlets the same way.

BONED TURKEY.
First make the stuffing to suit your taste. Take a turkey
that has not been drawn, so as to have no openings in it if possi-
ble ; if drawn, sew up the openings firmly before boning. I
take two chickens, one beef tongue, one can oysters, one pound
fresh, lean tenderloin pork. Have the turkey frozen and
thawed, the tongue boiled and skinned, the pork roasted, the
oysters taken out of the liquor, the chickens cut in small pieces,
and put on to boil, with just water enough to cover. Have the
turkey well washed and singed, being careful not to break the
skin; lay the turkey on its breast, cut off the legs and wings at
the first joint, cut down the whole length of the back, and with
a sharp knife separate the flesh from the bones, one side at a
time; throw the bones into the kettle with the chicken to boil.
Now for the filling: First lay the whole tongue to form the
breast; clear all the chicken meat from the bones, cut the pork
in small pieces, fill up your turkey, legs, wings and all, first ty-
ing ends of legs and wings tight. Have the chicken liquor well
boiled and seasoned. Put in chicken, pork and oysters, and a
little dressing; turn the chicken liquor into the turkey and sew
up firmly. Turn it over and shape it nicely with the hands.
Tie a cord tightly to the neck and draw it round and tie it to
the right wing, close to the body; tie down legs and wings; sew
around it a piece of strong cloth, and steam or roast. Leave
the cloth on till cold. Carve cold in round, thin slices, com-
mencing at the neck. This is a difficult dish to attempt by any
but a skilled cook. Some leave the bones in the wings and legs
as they are quite difficult to remove.
                                                 MRS. S. F. W.
MISSOURI STYLE FOR COOKING CHICKENS.

                                                 MRS. B. DAY.
BROILED CHICKEN.
Clean and split open the chicken, and lay it on the grid-
iron over a clear fire. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and
spread with the best fresh butter, and serve on a hot platter,
with a few sprigs of water-cresses around it. Serve lettuce
salad with it.
PRESSED CHICKEN
Two chickens boiled tender, chopped not too fine, add the
liquor they were boiled in, season with salt' and pepper, add a
few tablespoons of rolled cracker; mix all together. Boil four
or five eggs hard; put in a mold a layer of chicken and one of
sliced egg until the mold is full; press by putting a weight on
top. Beef or veal can be prepared the same way.

OMELET FOR ARTHUR'S BREAKFAST.
One coffee cup of sweet milk, three eggs (well beaten), with
one-half teacup of flour. Butter a <I>large</I> frying-pan, and when
moderately hot pour in the mixture and let it cook slowly, being
<I>very careful</I> not to let it scorch. When sufficiently hard to roll
or lap together add salt, butter and pepper, according to taste,
and after lapping it together, as you do a turnover, let it cook
slowly five minutes, then remove it to the platter for the table,
and eat while hot.
SNO WFLAKE OMELET.
Separate the white and yolks of six eggs, beat each very
light, then turn them together, seasoning with two tablespoons
of sweet cream, (or milk and a little butter), salt, and a dash
of pepper; then fry, a part at a time, as soon as one is done
fold it over and remove to the platter. This will make six or
seven omelets.

A DELICIOUS OMELET.
Four eggs well beaten, one cup of milk, half a cup of bread
crumbs. Put a generous piece of butter into the frying-pan, pour
in the mixture and cook slowly ten minutes. Slip a knife around
the edge, and if done just right, it can be turned or rolled as it is
put upon the hot platter. This is very light and more delicate
than if made of all eggs.

SALMON FOR A LUNCH OR TEA.
A pretty dish is to take a can of salmon, drain off the liquor,
lay the fish on a platter and with a silver fork pick it into bits.
Make a dressing as follows: The yolks of two hard-boiled eggs,
two mealy potatoes, two tablespoons of butter, one teaspoon
each of mustard and salt; rub them together smoothly with a
case-knife, then mix in vinegar to make it of the consistency of
thick cream ; lay this in spoonfuls here and there on the sal-
mon, and a ring of the white of the egg on the side of it, if you
like. Garnish the platter with nasturtium leaves and blossoms,
or parsley will do, or lettuce with it is very nice.
This dressing I use in making deviled ham for sandwiches,
and for nearly all kinds of salad. It was sent to me by Mr.
Dowd, of New York, more than twenty-five years ago.

Another nice dish for tea is to boil a cup of rice, very light
and dry, then poach eggs, that is, break them carefully into a
sauce-pan of water just at the boiling point, let them cook
slowly till you can lift them easily from the water, and lay
them on the rice, which you have spread upon a platter, put a
bit of butter, salt and pepper on each egg.

VEGETABLES,
MASHED POTATOES.
After cooking drain them well and let them steam for a
few minutes, then salt and mash well, add half a cup of milk,
or enough to make them moist, a liberal piece of butter, then
with a large spoon beat thoroughly for five or ten minutes. If
a rich yellow color is desired add the yolk of an egg. Dish
and serve immediately. If mashed potatoes must stand let it
be in a tureen in a warm oven, but <I>never</I> in the kettle on the
Stove.
                                                 MRS. F. E. YALE.
A pretty dish is to take well seasoned mashed potatoes, rub
them through a colander into a baking dish, taking care not to
settle them down, bake a light brown in a quick oven, and send
to table in the same dish.
POTATO CAKES FOR BREAKFAST.
Save from dinner a soup plate of mashed potatoes, add to
it half a saltspoonful of pepper, the same of nutmeg, a little
salt and the yolk of an egg; form into small cakes, put in a
buttered baking pan, brush the top with the white of an egg
and brown in a quick oven.
CREAMED POTATOES.
Chop cold potatoes rather fine, place over the fire with half
as much cream as potatoes, a dash of flour, salt and pepper. If
milk is used instead of cream add butter and a little more

SOUTRERN POTATOES.
Slice them as for frying, let them remain in cold water one
hour, put into a pudding dish, salt and pepper, a little milk.
Place in the oven and bake one hour, remove from the oven
and add small lumps of butter over the top, return to the oven
to brown.

ESCALOPED POTATOES.
Peel and slice potatoes thin same as for frying. Butter an
earthen dish, put in a layer of potatoes and season with salt,
pepper and butter, a bit of onion chopped fine, sprinkle on a
little flour. Put in another layer of potatoes and the season-
ing. Continue in this way until the dish is filled. Just before
putting into the oven, pour a cup of milk over. Bake three-
quarters of an hour. The onion can be omitted if not liked.
                                                 MRS. EMMA FERDON.
POTATO CROQUETTES.
Season finely mashed potatoes with salt, pepper and butter,
add sweet milk to moisten, mix thoroughly with it one beaten
egg, have a plate of rolled crackers, another of well beaten
egg and the frying pan with hot lard, make the potatoes into
small smooth pats or rolls, dip each into the egg and then into
the crackers and fry a light brown. Lay on brown paper first
to absorb the fat, and serve hot.
                                                 MRS. S. M. SPENCE.
POTATO PANCAKES.
Grate a dozen medium sized potatoes, after peeling them
and washing thoroughly, add the yolks of three eggs, a heaping
teaspoon of flour, and if they seem too dry a little milk will do
to thin them, with a large teaspoonful of salt, and lastly, the
whites of three eggs beaten stiff, and thoroughly beaten in
with the potatoes. Heat your griddle and put butter and lard
in equal proportions in it, and fry the cakes until they are
brown. Make them a third larger than the ordinary size of the
pancake.
WARMED-OVER POTATOES.
Put in a spider one cup of milk with a good piece of
butter. Let it boil, then thicken with a spoonful of flour,
slice the potatoes, not too thin, and add. Carefully stir them
a few minutes until thoroughly warmed, then serve immedi-
ately.
ANOTHER.—Put in a spider a piece of butter or fresh meat
drippings, chop an onion fine and put in the spider, let it brown
for a few minutes. Chop cold boiled potatoes, not too fine,
season with salt and pepper and add. Let them fry slowly,
carefully turning them from the bottom.

SARATOGA POTATOES.
Pare and slice with a cabbage cutter as many potatoes as
are to be required. New potatoes, or up to the 1st of Novem-
ber will require to lay in the water but a few hours, while old or
withered ones will be all the better if they soak (ready sliced)
two days. They <I>must</I> be thoroughly chilled and be curled, to
be very nice. Place over the fire a Scotch bowl containing lard
as for fried cakes. Draw your cooking table very near the
stove and spread over one end a cloth folded several thick-
nesses. Place the dish of potatoes on one corner of the cloth
for a weight and to have it near by, then lay a small handful of
the slices on the cloth and wipe dry with a small towel. When
dry and the lard is boiling hot throw in a few, stirring almost
constantly, with a skimmer in the left hand, while with the
right you are drying another handful. When a light brown,
remove to a collander and salt <I>slightly</I> with a salt shake. <I>Not</I>
with the fingers.
<I>Remarks</I>.—To make Saratoga potatoes is not a difficult
task, if properly understood. I am convinced that the most
frequent difficulty arises from the potatoes not being thoroughly
chilled, or being cut so thin that they cannot be dried, and so
mat together and take too much lard. They will keep several
days in summer and two weeks in winter without growing
strong, if the lard is sweet, and by throwing them in a pan of
any sort and placing them in a warm oven a few minutes, they
will regain all their original crispness and can be served hot.
                                                 MRS. GEO. A. DOUGLASS.
TO COOK GREEN TOMATOES.
Take full-grown tomatoes before they are turned, pare and
slice, then cook in clear water until partly done, turn off the
water, put on enough more to finish cooking. Season with
butter, pepper, salt and one half cup of cream. Toast a slice
of bread or as many as needed, and turn the tomatoes over it.
Send to the table hot.
                                                 MRS. P. D. NOBLE.
TO FRY GREEN TOMATOES.
Out in slices half an inch thick, roll in flour, salt and pep-
per and fry in butter.

PARSNIPS.
Wash and scrape, cut in slices lengthwise, boil till tender
then fry in butter, sprinkle on a little salt.
PARSNIPS.
Boil till tender, remove the skin and mash them in the
stew-pan with a little milk, a generous lump of butter, salt and
pepper.
SQUASH.
Boil till tender, having first removed the skin and seeds.
Mash and season with salt and butter.
Hubbard squash is very nice when baked, scraped from the
shell and seasoned with butter and salt.
CAULIFLOWER.
Cut off the leaves and stalk close to the bottom of the
flowers, let it stand in cold water a short time, then put in boil-
ing water, salted. Cook till tender. Serve hot with drawn
butter poured over it or eat it with vinegar if preferred.
CABBAGE.
Prepare and cook the same as cauliflower, not using the
drawn butter. Many persons think a piece of salt pork boiled
with cabbage improves it. It is excellent when cooked in the
water in which good, sweet corned beef has been boiled.
CABBAGE WITH MILK.
Shave the cabbage fine, put in hot water enough to cover
it, let it boil fifteen minutes, drain off the water, pour on a
cupful of milk, add salt, pepper and butter, and a spoonful of
flour, mixed with milk.
ASPARAGUS ON TOAST.
Asparagus should be boiled in fresh water, after having
been tied in bunches with the tops all one way. When thor-
oughly cooked, take out and spread lengthwise on the toast in
a deep dish, pour over the whole a gravy made from some of
the water the asparagus was cooked in, butter, pepper and salt.
VEGETABLE OYSTERS.
Wash thoroughly, scrape off the skin with a knife, cut
across in rather thin slices, stew until tender in water sufficient

the codfish, thicken with flour rubbed smooth with butter.
Toast slices of bread, put in a dish and pour the vegetable oys-
ters over. Send to the table hot.

CREAMED TOMATOES.
Pare and slice ripe tomatoes, stew until perfectly smooth,
add salt, pepper and a piece of butter the size of an egg; just
before taking from the fire stir in a cup of cream with a table-
spoon of flour made smooth in a part of it; do not let it boil
after the flour has been put in. Have ready pieces of toast in
a dish, pour the tomatoes over and serve.
                                                 MRS. S. H. ADAMS.
BOILED RICE.
Pick over and wash one cup of rice. Into three small
cupfuls of water put the rice, salt it well, let it boil twenty
minutes (the water should boil away), then remove to the back
of the stove and let it stand ten or fifteen minutes, keeping it
covered. Do not stir it, and pour it out .as carefully as possible,
so as not to break the kernels.
EGG PLANT.
Peel and slice, boil in water with a little salt until thor-
oughly cooked. Drain off the water, pour on sufficient milk to
cover the slices, add a few lumps of butter rolled in flour; when
it thickens stir in the beaten yolks of two or three eggs and
serve at once.
BOILED CORN.
Green corn is best when first picked; the husk should
never be removed until just before cooking. Remove all the
silk, and cut off the end of the cob close to the corn. Put in
boiling water with a little salt, cook ten or fifteen minutes.
STEWED CORN.
Carefully cut the corn from the ear, so as not to cut into
the cob, scrape the cob lightly so as to secure the milk, add
water to just cover, place in a stew-pan. cover and cook slowly
half an hour or more, until done. Add a little milk, season
with butter and salt.

spoons of flour, two tablespoons of cream or sweet milk, salt,
pepper, and butter, and drop in spoonfuls on a hot, well-but-
tered griddle.
                                                 MRS. W.
GREEN PEAS.
Do not shell them until ready to cook, put into enough
water to cover, boil twenty to thirty minutes: season with
butter, salt and a little flour made smooth. Serve hot.
BOSTON BAKED BEANS.
Soak over night one quart small white beans with one tea-
spoonful soda. Into an earthen ware pipkin with close-fitting
lid, put half the beans, then one lb. salt pork, well-streaked
with lean, and then the balance of the beans. Add three table-
spoonfuls of N. O. molasses, one teaspoonful soda, cover the
beans with water, and cook in a moderate oven seven or eight
hours. When done they should be nicely browned, soft and
juicy.
                                                 MRS. ETTA LEE FERDON.
BAKED BEANS.
One quart white beans, nicely picked and washed, soak
over night, put in fresh water, and cook until they begin to
crack open; then put them in a little stone crock, add sufficient
water to cover them, put in a little salt and soda and a table-
spoon of sugar. Three-fourths pound of pork gashed through
the rind, sink it in the beans even with the top, cover them
closely, and let them bake four hours.
                                                 MRS. BENNETT.
MACARONI.
Soak macaroni for two hours. Then let it boil for twenty
minutes, drain off the water, place in an earthen dish a layer of
macaroni, then a layer of grated cheese, till your dish is full;
season with salt, pepper, a tablespoon of butter and a cup of
sweet milk. Bake slowly one-half hour.
                                                 MRS. RAMSAY.
BOILED ONIONS.
Peel and wash, boil ten minutes, drain off the water, add
boiling water, boil and drain a second time; pour on more
boiling water, and cook until done; drain off all the water,
add salt, pepper, butter and milk or cream. The milk can be
omitted.

BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED WITH ONIONS.
Slice six or eight good sized onions, put into a frying-pan
with a tablespoon of beef drippings or butter, season with salt
and pepper, cover and let them cook until tender. If too dry
add more drippings, and fry until brown, stirring often to pre-
vent burning. Select a nice sirloin steak, and have it cut one
inch and a quarter thick. Broil rare or well done, as preferred,
remove to the platter and cover thickly with the fried onions.
The success of this dish depends largely on the selection and
cooking of the steak.

BREAD.
The art of making good bread is acquired, not only by the
closest attention to rules, but by a certain amount of experience.
This is absolutely necessary, and although accompanied by dis-
couragements, and frequent failures, it is the only way any de-
gree of success may be attained. First, one must be able to
distinguish good flour from poor: second, one must know when
to set bread and how long to let it rise, as it is affected so easily
by the temperature of the room in which it is placed. French
bread is said to be sweet and good, as a rule, and in making it,
<I>two things</I> contribute to this, <I>that is</I>, the <I>manner</I> and <I>form</I> of
baking. In making bread, they never make thick loaves. The
loaves being so thin, the heat strikes through very soon after
they are placed in the oven, hence, all the fermentation is
stopped; while in the case of large loaves, fermentation con-
tinues to go on after the bread has been in the oven some time, and
of course, much of the sweetness is lost. The time required
for baking is not less than three quarters of an hour; whether
more time is required or not depends upon the heat of the oven.
"The little fairy that hovers over successful bread-making ***
heat; not too little, nor too much, but uniform." To test
whether bread is done, rap gently with the fingers; if done, the
sound will be hollow, if not done it will be dull and heavy.
After removing the bread from the oven, take from the tins,
and tilt on one side uncovered until it becomes cool. Bread is
certainly a necessity, but we should not make it merely for this
reason, for if we make it because we <I>have</I> to, our family will
eat it for the same reason; while if we take pride and pleas-
ure in our work, we are sure to have the welcome "well done"
pronounced upon it, and the reputation of a good bread maker
is worthy any woman's ambition.
YEAST.
Make ready a stone jar, having it perfectly clean and sweet;


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                      (jubilee0096)
put into the jar two-thirds of a cup of sugar, two thirds of a
cup of salt, and one quart of nicely mashed potatoes; add the
water in which the potatoes were boiled; have ready a small
handful of hops in an earthen bowl, pour boiling water over
the hops and let stand a few minutes; then strain into the jar;
pour water over the hops again and strain into the jar, making
three quarts of the mixture; when milk warm add two-thirds
of a cup of yeast, or one yeast cake dissolved in a little water.
Let it stand in a warm place until light, or until it sparkles,
then cover closely and keep it in a cool place. Good for six
weeks.

BREAD.
To make good bread, sift into your bowl one quart of flour,
to which add three good sized potatoes, freshly boiled and
mashed, with warm water sufficient to make a thin batter; then
a teaspoonful of salt and a square of Flashman's yeast. If in
the winter, put it in a warm place, and it will take about three
hours to rise. When quite light, stir in sufficient flour to knead
easily, being careful not to make it too stiff. Work it twenty
minutes, then put it again to rise, and when light, make out
your loaves with as little handling as possible. Bake in a not
too hot oven.
                                                 MRS. E. E. ROYER.
ANOTHER.—— When potatoes are boiled for dinner, drain the
water off into a quart of flour, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one
tablespoonful of shortening, and a little salt. If not enough
water, add more and stir well. Put one yeast cake soaking,
and when the mixture is cool, add it, stirring well. In the
morning mix into the flour, with warm water; mix soft. When
light, roll into loaves. Do not make them large. Let it rise
again till very light before putting into a quick oven.

ANOTHER.—— Two quarts of warm water poured on a table-
spoon of sweet lard. Stir in flour (Minnesota is the best) till
it is a thick batter, boating (same as griddle cakes) for several
minutes, then add a tea cup of fresh yeast, setting it to rise in
a warm place. In the morning, early, mould for twenty minutes,
then set to rise till light, when you take dough for one loaf,
place on the cake-board and roll out the same as for pie crust,
sprinkling on flour when necessary, rolling up till you have

It is not every one who knows, however, that
brown bread, the old rye and Indian loaf, known in
New-England as Boston brown bread, makes the
most delicious bread to serve with milk and berries.
To make this bread, get a cup and a half of Indian
meal and a cup and a half of rye meal (not rye
flour), half a cup of molasses, five cups of sweet
milk, a teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of
soda. Mix the rye and Indian meal together. Add the
molasses, dissolve the soda in the milk and mix
all together thoroughly. Steam the bread in a tin
pail or mould for five hours.

                      (jubilee0098)
rolled out four or five times, then the loaf is ready for tins, let-
ting it rise till light. Care should be used in not getting in
too much flour. This quantity will make four loaves. The
sponge should be prepared at night in the summer; in cold
weather make the sponge immediately after dinner. At nine
o'clock p. m. mould as mentioned above, put in a warm place
to rise till morning, then use the rolling-pin process, which
requires great patience but gives you good, fine-grained bread.

YEAST.
One coffee-cup of grated <I>raw</I> potatoe, one-half tea-cup of
table salt, one-half tea-cup granulated sugar, a tea-cup of water
in which a handful of hops has boiled, three pints of <I>boiling</I>
water poured over these materials. When a little more than
luke-warm add a half cup of good yeast. When light put into
fruit jars and keep in cool, dark place.

in cool weather. For bread take about one pint hot water, add
salt, a little sugar and a pinch of soda, let it cool until it will
not scald the flour, then add flour until about as thick as pan-
cake batter. Stir in about one half of the meal yeast previ-
ously made and set in a kettle of quite warm water, <I>keeping</I>
warm. This sponge will quickly rise. Then pour into a pan of
flour, adding warm water and more salt if necessary, a table-
spoonful of melted butter and sponge it, letting it rise; knead
into loaves, let it rise and bake. But little kneading is neces-
sary.

small cup of molasses, when cool enough add a pint of light
bread sponge, thicken stiff with graham flour, put in a tin pail,
one deep enough to allow about four inches for rising, keep in a
warm place till light, which should be a couple of hours, when
light take a piece of old cotton wring out of warm water and
dredge with flour, tie it loosely over the top of the pail and
place in a kettle of boiling water, cover tightly and let it boil
from three to four hours, adding water from time to time.
When done remove the cloth and place in the oven for five
minutes to dry off, then slip a knife around the edge of the pail
turn bottom up on a plate and lift the pail off. When cool cut
in round slices.

SALT RISING BREAD.
At night or in the morning (early) scald out a quart
pitcher and in it put four tablespoonfuls of new milk and a
small one-fourth teaspoonful each of salt and soda. Add
boiling water enough to scald. When cooled so that flour will
not scald stir in enough to make a thick batter, cover closely
and set the receptacle in a dish of warm water. If water
gathers on top dust in a little flour and stir briskly. When
light set a sponge, putting flour in bread pan to make the de-
sired amount; make a depression in center, turn in a pint of
hot milk or water, which will scald some of the flour. Add a
little salt and enough very warm (not scalding) milk or water
to. make your bread. Pour in the rising and stir to a smooth
batter, sprinkle a little flour over top, cover with a clean cloth
and set in a warm place. When light immediately knead soft
into loaves, brush over the top with butter. Cover well and
keep warm until light. Bake in a quick oven twenty to thirty
minutes. Best results are obtained in using flour not ground
too fine.

CAKE.
In making cake, to insure success, it is necessary to observe
certain rules. Exactness in measurement is essential. As a
rule the whites and yolks of eggs should be beaten separately,
and the butter and sugar stirred to a cream. The butter may
be softened but never allowed to become hot. Sift the baking
powder with the flour. In nearly all receipts the flour is meas-
ured before sifting. Stir briskly, and when it begins to lighten,
transfer to the oven as soon as possible. Cake should be baked
in a moderate heat. Study your oven to know just where in it
to place your cake, as much of the success depends on the bak-
ing. To know when your cake is done pierce it with a broom-
corn, if it comes out clean, remove your cake carefully from
the oven. Great care should be taken not to jar or expose to
the air the cake while baking. Care must be taken also not to
get in too much baking powder as it will make it tough and
cause it to shrink. Eggs and baking powder are rivals, and
should be used sparingly when put together.
UNION CAKE.
Dark part. The yolks of three eggs, one cup of molasses,
half a cup of butter, three tablespoons of sour milk, one tea-
spoon of soda, two cups of flour, one cup of chopped raisins,
cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.

one cup of sugar, three-fourths of a cup of sweet milk, two cups
of flour, two teaspoons of baking powder. Put in the tin a
portion of the dark cake then of the white, alternately in the
same way until all the batter is used.

PRESERVES AND JELLIES.
DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING OR CANNING FRUIT.
When preserves are put in a jar they should be kept in a
very dry, cool place to avoid mold. They should be examined
two or three times in the first two months and heated again
if not likely to keep.
It is always well in canning fruit to take a cloth folded in
several thicknesses, wring it out of cold water and lay on a
table. On this set the cans for filling. In this way you may
pour in the boiling fruit without danger of the cans breaking
and also avoid the discomfort of standing over a hot stove
while filling your cans.
In making jellies it is best to put the fruit in a stone jar
placed in a boiler of hot water. When fruit is sufficiently
softened pour it in a coarse linen bag and suspend it with a
crock under it and leave it until it ceases to drip. While the
juice is heating, if the sugar is put in the oven and heated very
hot, and then added to the juice, it will cause the jelly to set
sooner and be a better color.
All fruit will form more readily in a jelly if not quite ripe.

HOW TO PRESERVE A HUSBAND.
Be careful in your selection, do not choose too young, and
take only such varieties as have been reared in a good moral
atmosphere. When once decided upon and selected, let that
part remain forever settled, and give your entire thought to
preparation for domestic use. Some insist on keeping them in
a pickle, while others are constantly getting them into hot
water. Even poor varieties may be made sweet, tender, and
good by garnishing them with patience, well sweetened with
smiles, and flavored with kisses, to taste; then wrap well in a
mantle of charity, keep warm with a steady fire of domestic
devotion and serve with peaches and cream. When thus
prepared they will keep for years.

BOUILLON.
Take three pounds of good, lean, fresh beef from any part
except the shin. There must not be more than two ounces of
bone to a pound of meat, and the less bone the better. Place
the meat in a soup-kettle with three quarts of cold water and
salt and set it on a good fire; after about thirty minutes the
scum or albumen of the meat will gather on the surface and the
water will begin boiling. Now place the kettle in a more
moderate fire; add one gill of cold water, and begin to skim off
the scum, which will take only a few minutes; then add one
middle sized carrot, half as much turnip, one middle sized leek,
a stalk of celery, one of parsley, a bay-leaf, one onion with two
cloves stuck in it, and two blades of garlic. Keep the kettle
between simmering and boiling heat for five hours. Strain the
bouillon and it is ready for use.

CUCUMBER PICKLES.
To one gallon best cider vinegar, not less than two years
old, add one cup fine salt and one tablespoon powdered alum.
Take nice fresh cucumbers, wash carefully so as not to bruise,
or rub off the stems, then turn boiling water over them; when
cool drain and put into vinegar. If you have not enough to fill
the jar at once, add more as you get them, stirring the vinegar
each time. When the jar is full if there is not sufficient vine-
gar to cover well, prepare more, adding salt and alum as at
first. Cover and set in a cool place ten or twelve days, then
turn the vinegar off, heat scalding hot, remove the scum, and
turn over the pickles while hot, when a white scum rises repeat
the scalding, three times is usually sufficient. At the last
scalding add a few green peppers or one ounce white mustard
seed, lay a clean cloth on the pickles with a weight to keep
them under the vinegar, tie paper over the top. These pickles
are very nice and will keep a year or more if desired.

half of water) when scalding hot turn over the cucumbers and

porcelain kettle of vinegar to which has been added a piece of
alum the size of a walnut, when scalding hot put in as many
cucumbers as can be covered by the vinegar. Do not let them
boil but skim out as soon as scalded through, and replace with
others, adding a small piece of alum. When this process is
through, throw out the vinegar and replace with good cider
vinegar, add spices, mustard seed and red peppers.

MISCELLANEOUS.
ROSE SACHET POWDER.
One-half pound of rose leaves, one-fourth pound of ground
sandalwood, one-eighth ounce of Attar of roses.
                                                 MRS. M. W. HARRINGTON.
POT POURRI.
One-half pound of dried rose leaves, one-half pound of
dried lavender, one-fourth pound of crushed orris, one ounce
each of broken cloves, cinnamon and allspice.
                                                 MRS. M. W. HARRINGTON.
TO MAKE A ROSE SCENT JAR.
Gather the rose petals in the morning. Let them stand in
a cool place, tossed up lightly, for one hour to dry off, then put
in layers with salt sprinkled between them, into a large covered
dish. You can add to this for several mornings till you have
stock enough; from one pint to one quart. Stir every morning
and let the whole stand ten days. Then transfer it to a glass
fruit jar, in the bottom of which you have placed two ounces of
coarsely ground allspice, and as much broken up stick cinna-
mon. This may stand six weeks closely covered, when it is
ready for the permanent jar, which may be as pretty as your
means can purchase. Have ready one ounce each of allspice,
cloves, cinnamon and mace, all coarsely ground, one ounce of
bruised orris root, two ounces of lavender flowers, and a small
quantity of any other sweet scented dried flowers. Mix together
and put into the jar in alternate layers with the rose stock
and a few drops of oil of rose, geranium, or violet, and pour over
the whole one gill of good cologne.
This will last for years, though from time to time you may
add a little lavender or orange flower water, and some seasons
fresh rose petals.

PASTILLES---FOR DEODORIZING ROOMS.
Two ounces of willow charcoal, one-quarter ounce of pul-
verized benzoine, one-quarter ounce of Cascarilla, one ounce of
pulverized nitre, one pinch of myrrh, one-fourth ounce of ben-
zoic acid, one-half ounce of mixed oils (lemon, geranium, cin-
namon, orange, lavender, neroli, citronella, burgamot, clove,
sandalwood, rosemary, and bitter almond.) Dissolve enough
gum tragacanth to mix with the ingredients and to make a paste
the consistency of putty. Mould with the fingers into little
cones the size of a thimble and set away to dry. Light with a
match when ready for use and let smoke.
                                                 M. S. KNOWLTON.
Equal parts of powdered alum and salt placed in the cavity
of an aching tooth will give relief immediately.
A cloth wrung out of very hot water and frequently re-
newed, applied to the part affected will prevent or remove dis-
coloration from a bruise.
A gill of fresh made coffee poured upon the breakfast plat-
ter alter it is ready to serve, will give it a rich color and flavor.
TO PRESER VE EGGS.
Fourteen quarts of unslacked lime, two tablespoons each of
salt, cream tartar and salt petre. Stir two or three times and
let stand twenty-four hours before using. Dip off as close as
you can without roiling, then add four quarts of lime, the same
amount of other ingredients as above, let settle and use as above
directed. After which begin anew.
This is a valuable recipe.
The liquor is dipped off into the crock in which you wish
to pack your eggs.
                                                 A. BELL.

Half a gallon of raw linseed oil, one pint of turpentine,
half a pint of aqua ammonia, half a pint of benzine, half a
pint of alcohol, one and one-half pints of cider vinegar.
                                                 MRS. FRANK MORRIS.
TO GET RID OF BLACK ANTS.
Get five cents worth of tartar emetic, mix in an old saucer
with sugar and water and place it where the ants trouble you.

                      (jubilee0159)
In twenty-four hours every ant will have left the premises. The
same dish of tartar emetic answers as well the second year as
the first; as the water dries add more.
                                                 MRS. A. BELL.
To rid your shelves of red ants sprinkle powdered borax
around the edges.
Use naptha or gasoline about moth infested articles. It in-
jures nothing and kills the destroyers.
