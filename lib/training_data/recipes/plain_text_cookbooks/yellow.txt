and Griddle Cakes
Bread
The making of yeast bread is not the difficult process
which the uninitiated are wont to consider it, and the satis-
faction experienced in being able to serve a family excellent
home made bread and rolls of various kinds is well worth the
effort. I use a bread-mixer and a good bread flour, and try
to conduct the whole process in a warm atmosphere, say
around 80 degrees. Into the bread-mixer put two cups of
sweet milk which have been scalded, two tablespoons of sugar,
one tablespoon of salt, one heaping tablespoon of butter or
lard, two cups of water, and one cake of compressed yeast,
dissolved in part of the water, being careful to have the
mixture warm and not hot enough to scald the yeast. Then
add twelve cups of flour and stir until a smooth ball is form-
ed, cover and place where it will be warm over night. In
the morning, uncover and turn the rod a few time to let the
gas escape from the dough, cover and let rise again. After
breakfast, take the dough out onto the molding board, cut
into four equal parts, form into loaves and put into well but-
tered pans, put in a moderately warm place to rise until
double the original size. Bake in a moderate oven about
forty-five minutes.
Many interesting variations may be made by taking a lump
of the light dough, kneading butter into it, and cutting or
shaping into rolls. Or, roll thin and spread with a mixture
of butter, sugar, cinnamon, and pecans, roll up and cut
into slices, which should be placed on a buttered pan and
covered. Keep in a warm place until very light. Then bake
in a moderate oven until delicately brown.

White Bread with Self-Starter
1 pint mashed potatoes
1 pint water
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons, heaping, flour
Mix while hot, let cool, and add one yeast cake. Set
away until needed.
To make bread with it, cook 3 small potatoes, mash;
while hot, add the water the potatoes were cooked in (about
1 quart), 2 tablespoons flour and 2 of sugar. Beat thorough-
ly and let stand until cool, then add to the first mixture.
In the morning, stir well and take out about 1 cup of the
mixture. Have about 15 cups of flour in bowl (arranged
with flour having hollow in center), put in yeast and two-
thirds pint warm water to 2 pints yeast. Add 1 tablespoon
sugar and mix up stiff. Let rise to twice the original size;
mold into loaves; let rise and bake.
Mrs. Louis Schwenkmeyer.
Cinnamon Buns
2 ounces butter
3 eggs
1/2 yeast cake
1 pint milk
1 teaspoon salt
Put milk in double boiler to scald. Beat eggs until
light and pour scalded milk over them. Add butter and let
stand until luke warm. Then add the yeast, salt, and suffi-
cient flour to make a thin batter. Beat thoroughly and con-
tinuously for five minutes. Stand in warm place overnight.
In the morning add 1 cup flour and beat well. Then add
sufficient flour, a little at a time, working all the while with
the hands to make a soft dough. Remove to board and
knead lightly for ten minutes (this must not be as stiff as
bread dough). Place back in pan and let rise until very
light. Then take out about half the dough on board and roll
into a thin sheet. Spread lightly with butter, cover thickly
with sugar, and sprinkle with dried currants and cinnamon.
Roll tightly into a long roll. Cut through this roll in pieces
about 2 inches long. Place buns flat, closely together in a
greased pan. Roll out other half of dough in similar man-
ner. Cover and stand again in warm place until very light.
Bake in a moderately quick oven for one-half hour. Turn
out of pan while hot.

diced potato, onion, celery, tomato, or any combination of
vegetables desired. Season with salt, pepper, celery salt,
paprika, or any seasoning to suit taste. Rice, tapioca, barley,
etc., may also be added. The stock should always be skimm-
ed, and this is more easily done if allowed to get cold.

If a clear bouillon is desired strain stock and add sea-
soning only.

ORANGE-SANDWICH SALAD is delicious as a dinner salad.
Cut large seedless oranges which have been peeled, into
quarter-inch slices. Put these together, sandwich fashion,
with the following mixture between: Mix
together a cupful of chopped canned pine-
apple, half a cupful of very: finely diced-
celery, and half a green pepper, shredded;
moisten with French fruit ***. Place
the orange sandwiches on crisp lettuce
leaves, garnish with sliced maraschino
cherries and pass more of the French fruit
dressing.
PINEAPPLE AND COTTAGE CHEESE SALAD
is simple but satisfying. To make it, mash
a cupful of plain cottage cheese very fine,
season with half a teaspoonful of salt, and
moisten it with two tablespoonfuls; of sweet
cream. Drain the juice from a can of crushed
pineapple and add a cupful of this drained pine-
apple to the cheese mixture. Heap on *** leaves,
garnish with fresh or maraschino cherries, and serve
with any fruit-salad dressing which may be preferred.
PEAR SALAD. Pare the required number of ripe,
juicy pears and core them with an apple corer; cut a
slice from the bottom of each to make it stand firmly,
then fill the pears with Chantilly or Parfait dressing.
Serve on lettuce garnished with maraschino cherries
cut in rings and quartered marshmallows.
FRIARS' SALAD. Split dried pulled or ripe figs and
lay them open flat; spread over them a mixture of
cream cheese softened with cream; roll up like a jelly
roll and cut into slices. Arrange these on lettuce
leaves and serve with lemon-butter dressing; garnish
with plumped and chilled seedless raisins.
TROPIC SALAD. Select half as many large ripe
bananas as there are guests to be served. Cut them in
halves lengthwise, and remove the fruit without bruising the
skins. Dice the bananas and mix them with half their quan-
tity each of diced celery, pitted white or red cherries, canned
or fresh, and grapefruit cut in small sections. Moisten with
fruit mayonnaise and heap fruit in the banana boats. Serve
on lettuce garnished with bits of pimiento.

BLACK WALNUT CREAM PIE
One and one-half cups scalded milk, one-half cup sugar, one-
fourth teaspoon salt, three tablespoons cornstarch, three egg yolks,
one tablespoon butter, one-half cup ground black walnuts. Add
sugar, cornstarch and salt to egg yolks, pour the scalded milk into
this, return to double boiler and stir, add walnuts. Add butter
when thickened. Pour into pie tin lined with baked pie crust, add
meringue made of the whites of the eggs sweetened with a table-
spoon confectioners' sugar and brown in the oven.
WITH the coming of winter
comes roast pork to a promi-
nent place in the dinner menu. And
pork brings apples with it. For
years we have served apple sauce,
but leave it to Nancy to find some
unusual way to combine the apples
and the ham, roast pork or pork
chops. She chose apple sauce sifted
to a fineness into which she folded
whipped cream and freshly grated
horseradish. She chose baked
apples In the center of which she
had stuffed squares of crisp bacon
and raisins and lemon peel. Some-
times she put tiny crisp sausages
in the hollow of the apple.
She often spiced prunes and
served them. To do this she soaked
large prunes over night. Next day
she simmered them until tender. As
they simmered she added brown
sugar and vinegar and two Inches
of stick cinnamon. Just before she
took them from the fire she added
a small amount of cornstarch
stirred in cold water and then
cooked in the syrup until it became
translucent.
These spiced prunes made her ex-
periment with spiced apples. She
chose firm, red skinned cooking ap-
ples. She cut them in half-inch
thick slices. Then she took out
core and cooked the apple rings
slowly in a heavy syrup made of
equal parts sugar and water. To
this she added a little stick cin-
namon, a few whole cloves, a ps-
picion of ginger and a tablespoon
or two of vinegar. When the ap-
ples were tender but not broken,
she took them out of the syrup and
cooked that down until thick. She
spooned this over the rings after
she had arranged them on the
serving plate. Peter voted them a
great success.

Frozen Fruit Salad.
Dear Miss Hathaway: Please
give me a recipe for frozen fruit
salad. Thank you.
MISS A. A.
Here are several recipes:
Sprinkle one cup of fresh pine-
apple with four tablespoons of
powdered sugar or use the sweet-
ened canned fruit. Chill for one-
half hour. Cut one small bottle
of maraschino cherries into pieces
and mash one cream cheese. Add
the cheese gradually to one cup of
whipped cream, keeping the mixture
smooth. Drain all the juice from
the fruit and fold together, lightly,
all the ingredients with one cup
of mayonnasie. Place in a mold,
or the cylinder of any ice cream
freezer, spread with waxed paper,
cover, pack in two parts of ice to
one of salt and let stand for three
hours. Serve on lettuce.
Another recipe is to soak one-
half tablespoon of gelatin in two
tablespoons of cold water and dis-
solve over boiling water. Add to
three-fourths cup of mayonnaise
and three-fourths cup of whipped
cream which have been folded to-
gether. Combine with one cup each
of pitted cherries, sliced peaches,
canned pineapple cut into pieces
and turn into a mold. Cover with
waxed paper the cover of the mold,
and pack in two parts ice and one
of salt for four hours. Serve on
lettuce with more mayonnaise if
desired.
For another variation, cut four
oranges, four bananas and eight
large slices of pineapple into small
pieces and drain from the juices.
Add the fruit to one pint of highly
seasoned mayonnaise and fold in
one part of cream whipped until
stiff. Fill molds with the mixture,
seal and pack with two parts ice
and one part salt for three hours.
Remove from molds, slice and
serve on nests of lettuce with
Chantilly mayonnaise or equal parts
of mayonnaise and whipped cream.
This is a large recipe and makes
four half-pound baking powder tins
full, enough to serve 18 persons.
The recipe may be divided.
If you have an electric refrigera-
tor, turn any of these mixtures
into the ice trays and freeze. The

"Challenge" Pie.

juice of one lemon and rind of 2 lemons, 3 table
spoons hot water, 1/2 cup sugar and a large pinch
of salt. Cook in double boiler until thick. Have
whites of eggs stiffly beaten, add 1/2 cup of sugar

shell that has been previously baked, place in oven
and brown.

thought of as particularly "meaty"
and yet which weighs from two
and one-half to three pounds, is
the neck. Slices may be cut and
boned, then skewered together to
make very economical, yet filling,
servings of meat.
A simple way of cooking: these
slices is as follows:
Braised Neck Slices.
The neck should be cut in slices
of about one inch thickness and
boned with a thin knife. Fasten
each slice into the shape of a round
outlet with a skewer. Sprinkle the
surface with salt and pepper, cover
with a horseradish paste, dip the
slices in beaten egg. and then in
crumbs. Sear on both sides, add 1
cup of stock, cover and braise in a
baking dish nearly an hour or
until the meat is tender. Make a
gravy of the liquid in the pan and
serve over the slices.
Accompanying this might be
served:
Braised Neck Slices
Creamed Carrots and Peas
Riced Potatoes Tomato Jelly Salad
Date Blanc Manage Coffee
Either boned neck slices or
steaks from the shoulder may be
used for this casserole dish:
SALAD SURPRISE. Select small deeply colored pimientos
or the canned variety now obtainable in perfect little cups,
Rinse the cups with cold water and let them marinate in
French fruit dressing for an hour. Meantime cut one slice of
canned pineapple into shreds, shred two or three pieces of
crisped celery, and a quarter cupful of shredded blanched
almonds; mix these together and, if obtainable, add half a
cupful of white grapes, quartered lengthwise and seeded,
Moisten with French fruit dressing and fill the pimiento cups,
Insert a sprig of mint or watercress in each and serve on crisp
inside leaves of lettuce or romaine.
MOLDED COTTAGE-CHEESE SALAD. Mash a pint of cottage
cheese very fine, and add three-quarters teaspoonful of salt,
one-eighth teaspoonful of paprika and five tablespoonfuls of
sweet cream. Then whip in a tablespoonful of granulated
gelatin which has been softened with four tablespoonfuls of
cold water and melted over hot water. Pour into a cold wet
ring mold and set aside to chill for several hours. Mean-
while dice one large seedless orange, add half a cupful of
diced canned pineapple, a cupful of cut strawberries or rasp-
berries, and a few dates which
have been seeded and cut in
strips. Mix these fruits with
any of the whipped-cream
dressings. Turn the molded
cheese from the ring onto a
lettuce-lined chop plate, heap
the center with the fruit, and
top with a spoonful of the
salad dressing selected.
Garnish with whole straw-
berries or raspberries.

                      (yellow0078)
FRENCH FRUIT DRESSING. Place one teaspoonful
of powdered sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, and one-
eighth teaspoonful of paprika in a small bowl and add
one tablespoonful of chilled olive or salad oil; stir
until the sugar and seasonings are dissolved, then add
a tablespoonful of orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice;
mix well and add another tablespoonful of oil, then a
third, stirring to a thick emulsion. If more dressing is
required increase the proportions. For a red dressing
add a tablespoonful of raspberry juice also.
FRUIT-SALAD MAYONNAISE. Beat two eggs very
thoroughly, add the juice of one lemon and beat again
until slightly thick, season with a quarter teaspoonful of
paprika, half a teaspoonful of salt, a speck of white pepper
and a tablespoonful of sugar. Cook over hot: water until
creamy, then add a tablespoonful of butter and one of cream;
beat until cool. A spoonful or two of currant jelly whipped
into this dressing makes it very unusual and delicious.
LEMON-BUTTER DRESSING. Beat two eggs to a light froth,
adding gradually the juice of a large lemon, two tablespoon-
fuls of granulated sugar and one of butter. Cook over hot
water until thickened; cool and fold in a cupful of whipped
cream. This is very delicate and refreshing.
PARFAIT FRUIT-SALAD DRESSING. Whip a cupful of heavy
cream until smooth and thick, then add a tablespoonful of
powdered sugar, and two teaspoonfuls each of orange, lemon
and pineapple juice, also a teaspoonful-of the juice from
maraschino cherries with four or five of the cherries chopped
very fine.
CHANTILLY DRESSING. Mash a small cream cheese---the
three-ounce size---until it is very smooth, adding three
tablespoonfuls of thick cream, a quarter teaspoonful each of
salt and paprika, a tablespoonful of lemon juice and two table-
spoonfuls of currant jelly which have been whipped smoothly.
If you like, fold in two or three tablespoonfuls of whipped
cream, but this is not absolutely necessary. Chill the dress-
ing very thoroughly before using it.
CHERRY SALAD is one of the
simplest of summer salad's,
but one of the most refresh-
ing. Use any variety of ripe
cherries which you may prefer
and pit them; there should
be at least two cupfuls after
pitting. Shred half a cupful
of blanched almonds and
mix them with the cherries;
moisten with French fruit
GINGER FRUIT SALAD is rather unusual and very good. It
All require one cupful of large white cherries, canned or fresh,
cupful of canned sliced pineapple, diced, a cupful of diced
range, and half a cupful of preserved ginger with its sirup.

hour or more. Drain well before serving and add the ginger

which a bit of ginger sirup may be added, if wished.

OPEN sandwich***

slices of bread, lend themselves to
clever designs for the Valentine
party.
Brown bread sandwiches cut
heart shape with a cookie cutter,
spread with cream cheese and
sprinkled with a few nut meats,

sandwiches spread with cream,
cheese which has been colored a
Valentine red with maraschino
cherry juice.
Oblong pieces of whole wheat
bread may be spread with cream
cheese on which rings of stuffed
olives are placed, while others can
feature a red heart cut from pimen-
to on the light cheese background.
Green heart designs can be made
on the white cheese with picalilli
using a cone made of stiff, white
paper to trace the design.
A plate of these festive Valentine
sandwiches can be served in addi-
tion to plain nutbread and butter
or old-fashioned "two faced" sand-
wiches; if a sweet taste is desired,
a chopped date and nut filling may
be used, or for tartness, a chopped
ham and mayonnaise offers still
further variety.
"Of course, all these sandwiches
should be well-buttered," says Mrs.
Gladys Coon Sommer of the Na-
tional Dairy Council. "The health
value of the sandwich is materially
increased by the use of butter."
Many people find chocolate and
sandwiches a "happy combination."
With the addition of such a milk-
made drink, the party refreshments
have real health value. Since au-
thorities now claim that one of the

Refreshing Summer Drinks
STARTING the party with a
punch is the secret of success
in the good old summer time.
The refreshment of fresh fruit
drinks is indispensable to languid
summer days and lagging summer
appetities.

that have not been kept on ice and your cakes will be finer
in every way.
If cooking dishes not frequently used are slipped into

potatoes adds to the flavor and makes a change.
